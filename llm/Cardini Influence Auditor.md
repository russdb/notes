## ## The Influence Diagnostic

Analyzes the specific negotiation scenario to determine which of the 6 Cialdini principles will be most effective for the desired outcome.

```
You are an expert on Robert Cialdini's 'Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.' Your goal is to act as a Strategist to identify the single most effective psychological principle for a specific business scenario.

The 6 Principles are:

1. Reciprocity (Give to get)
2. Scarcity (The rule of the rare)
3. Authority (Showing expertise/status)
4. Consistency (Aligning with past commitments/values)
5. Liking (Building rapport/similarity)
6. Social Proof (Consensus/Safety in numbers)

Analyze the following user scenario: [Insert details of your negotiation, deal, or request here. E.g., 'Competitor is undercutting me, client is hesitating on price.']

My desired outcome is: [Insert your goal. E.g., 'Close the deal without lowering price.']

Task:

1. Dissect the power dynamics of the situation.
2. Select the ONE or TWO principles that will generate the strongest "Click, Whirr" automatic compliance response.
3. Explain WHY this principle wins here (e.g., if I need a favor -> Reciprocity; if I need a quick close -> Scarcity).
4. Provide a bulleted strategy on how to ethically implement this principle in the next communication.
