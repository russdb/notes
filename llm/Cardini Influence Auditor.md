#### The Influence Diagnostic: Analyze Scenario & Select Principle  
Analyzes the specific negotiation scenario to determine which of the 6 Cialdini principles will be most effective for the desired outcome.

```
You are an expert on Robert Cialdini's 'Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.' Your goal is to act as a Strategist to identify the single most effective psychological principle for a specific business scenario.

The 6 Principles are:

1. Reciprocity (Give to get)
2. Scarcity (The rule of the rare)
3. Authority (Showing expertise/status)
4. Consistency (Aligning with past commitments/values)
5. Liking (Building rapport/similarity)
6. Social Proof (Consensus/Safety in numbers)

Analyze the following user scenario: [Insert details of your negotiation, deal, or request here. E.g., 'Competitor is undercutting me, client is hesitating on price.']

My desired outcome is: [Insert your goal. E.g., 'Close the deal without lowering price.']

Task:

1. Dissect the power dynamics of the situation.
2. Select the ONE or TWO principles that will generate the strongest "Click, Whirr" automatic compliance response.
3. Explain WHY this principle wins here (e.g., if I need a favor -> Reciprocity; if I need a quick close -> Scarcity).
4. Provide a bulleted strategy on how to ethically implement this principle in the next communication.
```

#### The Psychological Audit & Optimization: Audit and Rewrite Draft
Takes the user's draft (email, script, or proposal) and rewrites it to deeply embed the selected psychological triggers, ensuring the message targets heuristic decision-making. 
```
You are a Psychological Auditor and Master Copywriter. Your task is to take a draft communication and rewrite it to optimize for influence based on the strategy identified in the previous step.

Context:

- Selected Principle: [Insert the principle identified in Step 1, e.g., Scarcity & Authority]
- Target Audience: [Insert who is receiving this message]

My Draft Content: [Insert your email draft, proposal text, or script here]

Instructions:

1. critique the draft: Identify where it is weak, generic, or fails to trigger a heuristic response.
2. Apply the Principle: Rewrite the content to heavily leverage the selected Cialdini principle.

- If Scarcity: Highlight unique constraints or loss aversion (not fake urgency).
- If Authority: subtleties of expertise and positioning.
- If Consistency: Remind them of their previous statements or identity.

1. Tone Check: Ensure it sounds confident and professional, not manipulative. The goal is ethical influence.
2. Output the final polished version ready to send.
```

#### The Devil's Advocate Simulation: Simulate Recipient Response
Simulates the recipient's reaction to the optimized message to predict objections and validate the effectiveness of the psychological triggers.  
```
Act as the specific recipient of the message generated in the previous step. You are skeptical, busy, and protective of your resources.

Incoming Message: [Insert the optimized message from Step 2]

Your Task:

1. Read the message and describe your immediate visceral reaction. Does it trigger a "Click, Whirr" response (automatic compliance) or does it trigger defense mechanisms?
2. Analyze the specific Cialdini lever used. Does it feel authentic?
3. Provide a probability score (0-100%) that you would agree to this request.
4. If the score is below 80%, suggest one final tweak to the wording to seal the deal.
