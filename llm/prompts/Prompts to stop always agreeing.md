  5. The “Scientific Peer Reviewer” Technique

  What it does: Simulates peer review logic — clear, structured, and evidence-based critique.

  Prompt:

    “Act as a scientific peer reviewer. Evaluate my idea’s logic, data support, and clarity. Use formal reasoning. Do not be polite; be accurate.”

  

6. The “Cognitive Bias Detector” Technique
  

What it does: Forces ChatGPT to analyze biases in reasoning — both yours and its own.

  Prompt:

    “Detect any cognitive biases or assumptions in my reasoning or your own. Explain how they could distort our conclusions.”

  
7. The “Socratic Questioning” Technique

  What it does: Encourages reasoning through questioning — similar to how philosophers probe truth. Prompt:

      “Ask me a series of Socratic questions to test whether my belief or argument is logically sound. Avoid giving me answers; make me think.”

  
8. The “Devil’s Advocate” Technique

  What it does: Classic debate tactic — ChatGPT argues the counter-case regardless of personal bias.

  Prompt:

      “Play devil’s advocate. Defend the opposite view of what I just said with full reasoning and credible evidence.”

  9. The “Objective Analyst” Technique

  What it does: Strips out emotion, praise, or agreement. Responds with pure logic and facts. Prompt:

      “Respond as an objective analyst. Avoid emotional or supportive language. Focus only on data, logic, and cause-effect reasoning.”

  10. The “Two-Brain Review” Technique

  What it does: Makes ChatGPT reason like two separate thinkers — one intuitive, one rational — and reconcile the results.

Prompt:

    “Think with two minds: Mind 1: emotional, empathetic, intuitive Mind 2: logical, analytical, skeptical Let both give their opinions, then merge them into one refined, balanced conclusion.”

  Add-on:

  To make any of these more effective, add this line at the end of your prompt:

    “Avoid agreeing automatically. Only agree if the reasoning stands up to logical, factual, or empirical validation."

  ChatGPT mirrors human politeness, not human truth-seeking.

  When you add critical instructions, you turn it from a cheerleader into a thinking partner.
