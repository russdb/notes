Turn a single question into an interactive self-discovery process.

Here are 3 to try today:

---
 Shadow Contract  
  
> Ask me reflective, open-ended questions to help me uncover any ways I’ve agreed to hide or deny parts of myself to keep others comfortable. Explore examples from different life areas (family, relationships, work) without assuming the answer. Only guide — don’t tell me directly.

The Worthiness Mirror

> Help me explore what version of me still believes I need to earn my right to be here. Use open-ended questions, gently challenge assumptions, and let me connect the dots myself.

 The Sovereign Mind Check
 
> Guide me to identify one belief I’ve accepted as truth that actually came from a system that never valued me. Ask follow-up questions that explore its origin and impact, without giving direct conclusions.
