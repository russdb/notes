1. **Break everything into micro-tasks:** AI works better when you break the problem into small and clear pieces. Instead of saying, Build this feature, I break it into tiny steps like setup, logic, edge cases, and tests. When I do that, AI gives way better answers, and my brain feels less chaos and overload.
2. **Let AI write setups, tests, and scaffolds:** All the boring stuff we repeat in every project? Folder structure, configs, basic tests, starter files, and all these things AI can handle in minutes.
3. **Use AI for planning, not just fixing:** Most people only use AI to fix bugs or write small bits of code. But the real magic is when you let AI help plan the whole thing, like flows, logic steps, and how pieces connect. It reduces confusion and makes everything smoother when you start coding.
4. **Show them examples of the style you want:** AI learns fast when you show it your past work or some examples, ideas for reference. If I share one or two code samples in my style, it returns answers that feel like me, and it starts thinking like me. My old code becomes the best prompt.
5. **Ask AI to question your decisions:** Sometimes I ask AI, Is there a better way to do this? Or what am I missing? It often points out things I didn’t think of, like edge cases or performance issues. Feels like having a second pair of eyes.
6. **Always verify the first answer:** AI’s first reply is just okay. Not great, but not terrible, and not to take it as a final answer. When you refine it and iterate, that’s where the good output is produced.
7. **Speed isn’t the goal; clarity is:** AI doesn’t just make you faster, but it also makes your thinking cleaner. When your logic is clear, your code becomes cleaner too. The speed comes naturally after that.
