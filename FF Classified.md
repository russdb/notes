Looking for two owners, everyone is welcome.  

This is a long time league going since around 2007 when a league of ours was so big and popular it had to split into two halves. Because we are good guys, we draft as late as possible to account for injuries during pre season.

This is a higher scoring league, where we set the points slightly higher to make it a little more exciting. We have a range of owners from Platinum downwards.  

There are weekly prizes and other prizes besides just the league winnings.  

Positions:  QB, WR, WR, RB, RB, W/R/T, D, D, D, D, DB, DB, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN, BN, IR, IR, IR, IR, IR  

That's right, no TE, no K, no DEF.   

Here is the points breakdown, we do everything we can to try and ensure that defensive players are equal to offensive players.

Here is a spreadsheet with all players Off and Def going back to 2016, sorted by totals points scored.
