##### On using words

> “Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”

-Jean-Paul Sartre


> Fascism is a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood, and by compensatory cult of unity, energy, and purity in which a mass based party of committed nationalist militants, working in an uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and persues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints, goals of eternal cleansing and external expansion. 

-Robert Paxton, anatomy of fascism.
