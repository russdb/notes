### Roman Conquest of Iberia  

*By the second and third centuries CE, it would be fair to say that most of Spain was securely integrated into the imperial system.21 In summary, the drawn out nature of the Roman conquest of Iberia and the
peninsula’s varied human and physical geography undoubtedly shaped the provincial boundaries of Roman Hispania. However, equally important were the decisions that were taken at higher levels about the military and administrative organization of the peninsula. Especially significant was Hispania’s relationship with other parts of the empire such as the frontier garrison.*

gradual, at least partly because different parts of
the Iberian Peninsula had engaged with the Mediterranean socio-economic world for varying periods of time  

the south and east were characterized by more city-based political and economic organization and were more fully-integrated into Mediterranean economic  

more central and northern parts of Spain had less in common with existing Roman social and political systems and were thus more difficult to reconcile to Roman rule and to incorporate into the empire after the conquest  

Scholars have established that the relationship between pre-Roman and Roman cultural, economic, and social practices was by no means uniform within and between these regions
