'It's complicated.'

There are a few different ways to approach this question.

#### **Textual accounts**

The first, and the method longest favored, has been to trust the written sources. These include Gildas' sermon, Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and other later texts. Each tells a slightly different version of the arrival, in boats, of Saxon mercenaries who turn on the hapless Britains, conquering and/or enslaving and/or driving them from England into the hills of Wales.

You are correct that these texts are no longer trusted, however. Why? First, scholars have done a lot of legwork to track down Bede's sources, and it's very clear that Bede based his account of the Anglo-Saxon arrival directly on Gildas. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (which, remember, was written 400 years after these events) gives no indication of having any other unique sources either. Hence, these are not actually three separate accounts that agree, but one story, repeated two additional times. If we read Gildas, we're on the same footing as Bede.

So what happens when we read Gildas? Late Antique historians have, for the past 30 years, done a lot of really good work studying the genre and literary function of ancient and early medieval texts. What I mean by this is that we've come to recognize that ancient texts weren't written by people who necessarily were interested in telling the same kinds of stories we assume they are. A modern historian would, for instance, be interested in knowing precisely what people did, and how these actions influenced the events that followed. Late Antique authors, however, were often much more interested in how people's actions communicated their _moral_ virtue, and hence tend to write stories where our ability to understand whether someone was good or bad is privileged over strict attention to causality. The author of the Historia Augusta doesn't tell us about Elagabalus' kinky sex life so we know _why_ he was assassinated; he tells us about it so we know that the emperor _deserved what he got_. The things that authors emphasize vary by genre, by the author's context, by the objectives of the piece they were writing -- lots of factors. So just as a good literary scholar much think hard about how to distill meaning from a work of fiction, we must approach our historical texts with great care if we want to know what they're really on about.

Gildas wrote a sermon, and the central theme is about the consequences of rebellion against God. He uses examples from the scriptures to warn of the consequences of sin, goes through a list of corruption practiced by five bad contemporary kings, criticized the contemporary church, and calls his listeners / readers to repent. He also uses a long example from history to set this up, and this comes at the beginning of the sermon. It's easy to read this example from history as an objective account, but we have to remember that it's actually an introduction meant to get us to the real issue Gildas cares about, which is the consequences of rebelling against God.

In this historical story, Gildas rattles off the history of Britain, and he frames it as a sequence of rebellion vs submission. The Britons were weak by themselves, but Rome conquered them and made them strong. They rebelled, which made them weak, but the Romans conquered them again and this was actually good because submission to Rome made them strong. Then the Romans gave them Christianity, and they got even stronger. But they rebelled _twice_: against the Romans (by sending a usurper, Magnus Maximus, to the Continent with their armies), and against God (by embracing the Pelagian heresy). And that made them weak.

This is where we get to the part that historians of the Anglo-Saxon conquest care about. Britain was being raided in the fifth century, and they asked for help -- Rome sent it, they were saved, but then the Romans left because the soldiers were needed elsewhere. Before they left, the Romans built a wall in the north (Hadrian's Wall?? Only, that was built 300 year earlier). Britain was raided a second time -- the Roman army came and saved them again, building another wall (the Antonine Wall? Again, the chronology is way off -- but ok). A third time, Britain called for aid -- and Rome was fighting off the Huns and could spare no men. So the British asked for Saxon mercenaries, and they came, and they stayed. Shortly thereafter, these mercenaries were burning down Romano-British towns, killing their inhabitants, and Britain was ruined. But GOD sent the last Roman, Ambrosius, who beat the Saxons at Badon Hill. The moral? Britain never should have rebelled in the first place. But GOD _will_ help you get back on the right path after you've sinned. So repent now, before it's too late!

So -- what do we do with this as a historical document? It's actually very vague on details. There's no mention of Hengist or Horsa, the two brothers (both named 'horse') who supposedly led the Saxon mercenaries. Gildas, in fact, is talking about events as though he expects his audience to already know what's going on. And he's clearly embroidering the story to make it work for his story, adding dramatic elements like the construction of Hadrian's Wall in the fifth century to make the narrative more compelling. His real goal isn't to tell us what happened; it's to get his kings to repent and turn back to God. But there are some details lurking in the text that are probably true. So let's leave Gildas with a ?, and look at the next source of evidence.  

#### **Archaeological evidence**

In the 18th century, a man by the name of Bryan Faussett became very interested in the antiquities that workmen on his land were uncovering, particularly old rusted spearheads and jewelry from burials which he believed belonged to the Anglo-Saxon migrants that Bede tells us about.

Over the next 100 years, more and more of these antiquities were discovered (thanks in large part to the development of canal and rail networks, which caused large portions of the countryside to be excavated). By the 1870s, hundreds of middle class men with enough free time to invest in serious hobbies were studying this material in local antiquarian societies (universities did not, yet, have archaeology departments), and one group wrote a book in which they argued that these archaeological finds were the physical proof of the story that Bede told about the Anglo-Saxon conquest. They took it a step further, though, and mashed together all the different sources (from hundreds of years apart) into the incredibly detailed account with which we're all familiar (Hengist and Horsa, Vortigern, and the rest). This became standard reading for English school children, and formed the backbone of British national identity by the end of the 19th century. The WASP (white Anglo-Saxon protestant) identity emerged at the same time: nationalism was sweeping across the western world, and the Anglo-Saxon conquest was chosen as the moment when 'English' identity had been born.

Over the next century, archaeologists professionalized, and the amount of data they had at their disposal grew. Scholars like T.E. Leeds made maps of the 'Anglo-Saxon' finds, and used these maps to show where different kingdoms were, and how much land had been conquered. The idea was that if a particular style of brooch were found where Bede said the Jutes had landed, that brooch was 'Jutish' -- and if we mapped where all the Jutish brooches were found, we could draw a line / political boundary around the kingdom these conquerors formed (if this logic sounds a bit circular -- it is). Leeds gave us maps like [this one (published 1913)](http://andrewwelton.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image.jpeg)

.

However. A few things happened to cause this story to be questioned.

First, by the 1980s, it was becoming clear that the archaeology didn't tell such a simple story. There was a lot of stuff that archaeologists thought was 'Anglo-Saxon' -- but there was a lot of stuff that wasn't, as well. And the Anglo-Saxon stuff didn't look quite like the archaeology in Anglia or Saxony from the same period. In fact, a lot of it looked like a hybrid between 'Germanic' and Romano-British cultural styles. Archaeologists began to question just how many Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated -- perhaps it was only a small band of elites, who ruled a British population which adopted the dress and culture of their conquerors (a model known as 'elite replacement'). That is, maybe the Saxons didn't drive the British into Wales -- they just took them over from the top-down. In some cases, the cultures seemed to have blended: certain styles of jewelry looked like hybrids of earlier local styles with new styles that resembled those from Germany. Some archaeologists went so far as to question whether the conquest had happened at all: perhaps the British people merely adopted the _culture_ of Saxony without a violent conquest. This peaceful version of events was encouraged as more and more Roman cities were excavated, and archaeologists found _no evidence_ of the violent destruction that Gildas said had happened (Roman cities in Britain were peacefully abandoned, not sacked).

The second line of criticism, which is still ongoing, was theoretical. A number of archaeologists began to ask a really important question, which was: how do we know this jewelry, these weapons, etc are _Anglo-Saxon_? Remember that folks like Leeds had _assumed_ that new jewelry styles found where Bede said the Jutes landed were Jutish styles. But the logic behind this is fuzzy: the jewelry is a new style, and it appears in one area, but the only reason to say it's _Jutish_ is because we assume Bede was right that these people landed and lived in that part of England. But if we want to be really honest, all we have is a bunch of brooches: we don't know that these pins were worn by only _one_ people group (maybe multiple groups wore them), we don't know that these people were _Jutish_ (perhaps only local women conquered by the Jutes wore this jewelry -- we just don't know!), and we don't know whether the pattern we see might have been caused by something else like geography (similar objects are usually found along river valleys -- is that because everyone along the valley was a Jute, or because people traded jewelry up and down the river?). As a consequence, archaeologists started to look for new ways to talk about people groups that didn't just assume that you could tell where someone was from simply on the basis of the jewelry or weapons they had buried in their graves. (See Sam Lucy's book, _The Anglo-Saxon Way of Death_ [2000] if you want to go into more detail on this debate). One of the ways we are doing this is with scientific evidence.

#### **Science**

There are a few new, exciting scientific methods we can use to trace where someone is from.

When we're young and our teeth are still forming, the minerals in our drinking water get trapped in our teeth. Depending on where you grow up, the ratios of stable isotopes in our water will vary slightly. By grinding up a person's tooth and measuring the ratios of Oxygen or Strontium, we can determine whether or not someone grew up in the village where they were buried. With Oxygen, we can usually also tell if they grew up to the west or east of this village: in Wales, or else in Germany.

In the past decade, many cemeteries have been studied with this method, and the results are fascinating. There _were_ migrants from the Continent buried in English cemeteries -- but often, these weren't the people with the 'Angle' or 'Saxon' jewelry. The people with this 'foreign' jewelry are often locally born. In many cases, people migrated from the _west_, from Wales -- something that Gildas certainly never mentions (it's migration in the wrong direction!). This means that people did move -- but their movement was not a simple conquest from Germany to Britain. And the archaeological artefacts once thought to clearly mark the difference between Germanic migrants and locals is, as many critics had suspected, not so simple after all.

More recently, DNA has become another tool for tracing migrations. This has been done several different ways, and still has a lot of problems that have to be worked out. The most famous study looked at thousands of modern English persons' DNA, and looked for small mutations which can, through computer modeling, be related to populations in other modern European populations. One result of this study was the finding that people who live in lowland Britain (the area where the Angles and Saxons supposedly settled _are_ related to people in N. Germany. The study authors argued that this was proof of the Anglo-Saxon migrations, and suggested that between 10-40% of the modern population in this region descended from these migrants. This is both much lower than was once thought (back when historians thought that the Anglo-Saxons drove all the Britons into Wales), but higher than some of the more skeptical critics had argued in the 80s.

There are problems with this study. For one, the mutation that links Germany and England diverged c. 800, 350 years after the Anglo-Saxon migration was supposed to have happened. Perhaps people were continuously traveling back and forth across the North Sea during this period, or perhaps some of the common DNA actually resulted from the Viking Invasions of the 9th century. There's ongoing debate. But it's interesting science.

Another study recovered the DNA from several ancient bodies in a cemetery in Cambridgeshire. It found that some bodies were very closely related to modern Continental populations, ie they were migrants from the Continent. Others were local Romano-British. And some were a mix between the two -- ie, they were intermarrying. They also did an istopic study of their teeth, and found that these people were eating the same diet. Ie, they weren't just making babies together, they were sharing meals. That, the lead investigator of the cemetery argued, suggests that we're not seeing Germanic rulers and British slaves; we're seeing a real community where the people of different ancestry were mingling.

More work along these lines is ongoing, and we'll see more interesting results soon I'm soon.

However...  

#### **Race vs. Ethnicity / Biology vs. Culture**

The big difficulty determining who was an Angle, Saxon, Jute, or Roman Briton isn't just figuring out where they were born or who their parents were. Ultimately, it's a question of culture: what did people _call_ themselves? Since few people left written records in these centuries, the answer almost always is that we don't know. There's ample evidence that people interacted across cultural lines: art styles mixed, DNA mixed, migrants and locals were buried in the same cemeteries. This suggests that culture was complicated, much as it is today: someone might not die with the same identity with which they were born. So as we look at the people in England, we honestly struggle to know whether they thought of themselves as Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, or something else entirely.

Until they start writing things down. And when they do, these lines start to be drawn. Early sixth century Britain was pretty fragmented. Halsall in _Worlds of Arthur_ argues that the island may have been united into large kingdoms like contemporary Gaul, but in N. Gaul as well there were few elites, and people lived for the most part in tiny rural settlements that were all, roughly, equal to one another. This changed by the seventh century, as new kings emerged in Britain and consolidated their power. These kings were interested in dynasties, and they started to identify with the stories of migration. If you look closely at their family trees, you can see that this process involved some choices. The kings of Wessex, for example, had British names for several generations. But by the seventh century, they identified themselves as West _Saxons_. This is why it's important to remember that culture and identity don't have to match biological ancestry -- these kings _could_ have called themselves Romans or Britons, but they chose to emphasize the Saxon migrations for their origins, much as I choose to identify more strongly with the English rather than French or German side of my family tree, while my spouse identifies as Polish instead of German. If we wanted, we could change our last names to O'Brien and convince everyone we were Irish. That, it seems, is what was happening in the seventh century, and perhaps a little earlier in the sixth. People were still moving (isotopic and genetic evidence both show evidence for migrations ongoing in the 7th and 8th centuries), but in England new royal powers had started to settle on stories that made their ancestors out to be heroic conquerors who came from Germany, while in Wales chronicles began to tell stories about Arthur who had valiantly defeated those damned Saxon invaders. Lines were being drawn, and politics were at the heart of it.

**Tying it all together**

So -- were there migrations? Yes.

Was there a violent conquest? Here the evidence is much less certain. Roman Britain changed radically and rapidly, but there's little evidence for violence, and economic and social processes offer better interpretations of the evidence. People _changed_, they weren't slaughtered or driven away.

How many people migrated? This is still contested. If you buy the logic of the recent studies, between 10-40% is likely, but probably not much more. But there's reason to question these numbers; and the migration may have lasted many generations rather than being a single event, so we needn't imagine 100000 newcomers showing up in the space of a few years. It was probably more of a steady trickle (which doesn't mean that some people, Gildas among them, wouldn't have noticed the change).

But we should remember that the Late Antique world (and the ancient world, too) was characterized by mobility. Saxons were moving into Britain to serve in the Roman army in the 4th century, and Saxons were crossing into Britain in the 7th century too. Barbarians were constantly crossing into the Roman empire before its power weakened, and the mobility of people in the 'migration age' was not a _new_ phenomenon.

Hence, we should be careful not to assign too much explanatory power to migration in understanding why early Anglo-Saxon England looked so different from late Roman Britain. Personally, I think that technological change, related to economic changes, is the real source of England's new culture.

Halsall's book will give you a great perspective on all this (it's one of my favorites on this subject). I would also recommend Robin Fleming, _Britain After Rome_, and James Gerrard, _The Ruin of Roman Britain_. Fleming is more readable (and more affordable) than Gerrard, though both are excellent.  


> The bit which puzzles me is the Roman cities. If as you say there's no evidence of sacking, why were they abandoned? Especially as I understand (though could be wrong) that later Saxon settlements were often built next to their ruins in order to pillage the stone. If it was simply a peaceful migration or cultural shift, why wouldn't they go on living in the same cities?  

Roman cities actually start collapsing in the early fourth century, and are almost entirely abandoned by 450 when, supposedly, the Anglo-Saxon invaders came. This is part of a larger economic collapse in Britain: elite villas collapse, late-scale economic production disappears, and ordinary people -- who had been doing the backbreaking labor to keep this whole system going -- actually become a little happier and healthier once they were no longer paying the taxes and doing the labor to keep the walls standing. The reason for this collapse is probably the movement east of Roman administration (away from Trier), which took a lot of resources away from Britain (which was otherwise on the extreme edge of the empire).

Robin Fleming's book _Britain after Rome_ details this collapse, as does Gerrard _The Ruin of Roman Britain_. Rogers _Towns in Late Roman Britain_ talks about the slow decline and 'transformation' of British cities.  

> So the general idea is that it was a mixture of migrations and cultural shifts, with a few conquests in between. Is that a good summary of the current consensus on the topic?  

There were migrations, though their scale and social impact is debated; there was violence, though whether it can be described as 'conquest' is also debated. What caused the cultural transformations we see in post-Roman Britain is also up in the air: it was more than migration; but precisely how important economic changes, demographic changes, religious, cultural, or technological (my favorite) were in this process is still very much debated as well.

It's actually a pretty exciting field to be working in. Many parts of history have a well established narrative and we can say with a fair bit of certainty what was going on. Thanks to improved understanding of the texts, the discovery of _vast_ quantities of new archaeology in the past few decades, and the development of new theories and methods for analyzing this archaeological data, our understanding is really being transformed.

But if you want to tl;dr it, the answer is: lots of people moved around, some peacefully and some not, and within 100 years the island's culture, economy, and landscape was totally different. But we're still trying to figure out why this all happened.
