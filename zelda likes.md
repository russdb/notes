If you're looking for games like Zelda, I've got you covered. I've personally played and would recommend:

-   **Hob.** An atmospheric Zelda-like that goes for a non-verbal storytelling style, which I'm a huge sucker for.
-   **The Darksiders games.** The Zelda formula combined with hack and slash combat akin to DMC or God of War. If you find the combat in the Zelda franchise lacklustre, you'll probably enjoy the Darksiders games.
-   **The Oceanhorn games.** Fairly conventional Zelda-likes that were originally developed for mobile. Both games have slightly janky controls, but are great fun if you can look past that.
-   **Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion.** Quite short (approx. 2 hours) so you may want to wait for a sale, but has a great sense of humour that consistently got me laughing.
-   **Yono and the Celestial Elephants.** A chill Zelda-like with a lot of heart. It’s also on the short side, though not as short as Turnip Boy.
-   **The Ittle Dew games.** Self-aware parodies of Zelda games. Some people are really into that kind of humour; others aren't. Your mileage may vary.
-   **Blossom Tales: The Sleeping King.** A self-aware parody of Link to the Past specifically. Like the Ittle Dew games, your enjoyment will depend on how much you enjoy that kind of humour.

That should be more than enough to get you started. If you want more Zelda-likes, check out these previous two posts of mine:
