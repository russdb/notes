six fitness coaches. Three on each category. Put yourself and ass man at normal training categories, add 2 GK coaches for GK. If there's still room, find some normal coaches with _model citizen personality_ 

Instead of training in position, **add double intensity on individual training**

**Model citizen, Model pro, or Pro personalities**, you might also have an increase in determination for many players. But not always so easy to find so determined and fairly determined also work.

**Select automation on all in individual**, and go to the “rest” page to automate double intensity over 80 and 90%.

79% plus condition go for double intensity

great way to help bolster the tactical prowess of your team is to add in a Match Review session  
can add this to any training day the day after a match.
good way to help improve your team's tactical focus and to help minimise repeating the same errors

#### Don’t worry about delegation
By having him coach most of the squad on what they are already working towards well, I can focus my energy on working on the four or five players who need specific focus and development.
