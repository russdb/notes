flair seems to be important

#### three types forwards 
playmaking: the facilitators, ie false-nine an deep lying  
attacking forwards: advanced and poachering forwards 
outliers: complete and pressing forwards  

#### advanced forwards:  
applying pressure oon the back line  
first touch, off ball movement, etc
has more freedom than poachers  

deep lying forward
