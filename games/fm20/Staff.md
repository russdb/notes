**criteria** for any potential 5-star coach are their **attributes**, **coaching badges** and **personality**

having the best staff won't significantly aid your players' development if you don't possess s**tate of the art training facilities**

must first look at their **Determination, Level of Discipline and Motivating** attributes  

out of the three, **determination** is most important

Once you have found a coach with high numbers in these three key areas you can assess his attacking, defending or goalkeeping attributes

**Personalities** play a big role in players and coaches

ideally you want them to have either of these three personalities, **Model Citizen, Model Professional or Professional**.

offer **5-star coaching** in each individual area of training you can only afford for each coach to be assigned to **one** specific area

match these key attributes along with high **Motivating, Level of Discipline and Determination** stats to discover the best coaches in each area

**coaches** just like **players** **develop**  

dont be afraid to offer clauses you will never have to pay
