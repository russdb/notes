#### loans

find the player that wants to go out on loan an go to transfer -> offer to clubs. this is very powerful! 

make sure you lock in the percentages!

ensure they get regular playing time and then add a condition for a buyout at a ridic high fee just in case.

#### transfers
when you've found a player, don't go straight into contract, go to transfer -> make an offer and see if you can get it for less. See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybB4HZDUNQA&t=213s  

good idea to start off setting him with no amount, then set benchmarks later

make sure to remove and exclude the selling teams salary contributions and only add it back in if you can't get any offers  

in player tab, go to transfers and you can select to auto reject offers.
#### renegotiation  

a good strategy is to renogotiate every two years, and promise to give the player good playing time in two years, do this over and over :)
