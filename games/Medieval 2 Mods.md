Copied my comment from a previous post, but here’s a recap of some M2 moda I play the most. Stainless Steel: Keeps the medieval setting, but expands the map and adds a few factions. Removed the limited Americas late game map, but adds more of Persia and Central Asia. Fantastic overhaul, adds a lot of depth and historical background to the vanilla game. A mod I keep coming back to. Third Age: LOTR overhaul mod. Set during the ahem Third Age, War of the Ring. I’ve played Divide and Conquer and MOS, and both are great. A few added factions for Divide and Conquer, which extends the number of playthroughs. Europa Barbarorum II: The ultimate history nerd mod. Set during the early Roman Republic era. Expands the map all the way to northern India. Fantastic mod, incredibly well researched, and very complex. A little buggy at times, but worth it just for how different it is from vanilla. The Elder Scrolls: Haven’t played in awhile, but a great overhaul in the making. Recently updated I believe so might be even better now. Set in Tamriel, with access to most of the major factions from TES series. Adds some magic elements (as much as the M2 engine can anyway) that adds depth.
