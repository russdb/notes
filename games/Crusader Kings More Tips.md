I thought I'd create this post for future players that would like to quickly understand some vague concepts in CK2. Some of them are not obvious at all, and are different to the usual 4X game play. I'm fairly new to the game (~50 hours) and have been slow to realize a few concepts outlined below:

**It's perfectly fine to start off as a Count or Duke.** There's literally nothing wrong with it, and I wish I had tried starting as a Count sooner. Playing as a Count teaches you what a Liege means, and why it's important. You won't get access to the best military commanders, spouses, or other characters, but you can take your time figuring out what's going on in your kingdom.

**If you're not a King, don't get freaked out by all the wars that seem to be happening without your input.** If you didn't get a notification saying that someone declared war on you, then the war belongs to your Liege (Duke) or your Liege's Liege (King). You don't need to contribute in any way, and in fact, shouldn't unless your territory is being directly impacted. If you contribute and kill off all your troops over someone else's war, then you are more susceptible to other Counts or Dukes claiming your territory.

**Don't declare independence.** When you are part of a feudal society, you are protected by your Liege. If you declare independence, you won't have any more protection (if you even win the war) and are much more likely to be preyed on by other empires. Remember that your King protects your land and it's in his best interest to ensure other empires don't claim your land.

**As a Count, your first steps will be to fabricate claims on other land within your Liege's Duchy.** Go to war with them, your Duke or King cannot intercede. Gain a few Counties and become friends with your Duke if you can. He might throw you a bone when he needs to give away some land. Remember that he will also be fighting other Dukes for more land.

**When you see troops randomly leaving your lands, these are the troops owed to your Liege.** You can't command these and aren't expected to provide more. The number of troops you give your Liege depends on how much you like him. This is an important concept because once you become Duke, you'll want your Counts to like you, so they can provide more troops for you.

**Your income is comprised almost entirely of your Demesne.** Don't expect to get much from your other vassals - Counts, Dukes, or Kings (if you're an Emperor). Ensure that you pump up your castles in each holding as much as possible. Just because you're King doesn't mean you are making more gold than your Dukes, they could be out earning you if they have better holdings.

**Don't bother spending money on your Churches and Cities** in your holding until all your Castles in all your holdings are completely upgraded. You only get a portion of the income from your Churches and Cities, whereas you get full income from your Castles (Baronies).

**Don't join Factions willy-nilly against your Liege.** He knows what you are up to and might just revoke your titles as punishment. It might seem like fun to try and overthrow the King until he goes to war with you and tries to revoke your capital.

**Being good to your vassals** usually goes a long way to earning their trust. If you imprison and humiliate/execute them, their children will hold a vendetta against you until either of you die. If you're going to be a tyrant, make sure you're a ruthless one (and have at least 10 intrigue!)

**Before going to war,** check your opponent's troop numbers, allies and gold. Don't go to war unless you can win it easily!

**Surrender if you have to!** You don't need to win every war, as you won't suddenly lose an entire Kingdom in one go (as in EU4). Wars are most often fought bitterly over a single title, or a bit of land. Give it up if it means that you can strengthen yourself enough to take it back later. There's a 10 year truce after every peace, and the A.I doesn't break it.

Edit: There will be exceptions to each of these tips as this game is really strategically diverse. These are just my beginners tips I wish I had known when I had started out. I acknowledge and appreciate any other tips and strategies for this incredible game!
