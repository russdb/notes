I spent some time writing this step by step guide on how to set up for a kingdom with little room to fail. Of course your enjoyment as the player is what matters, so you may choose to either ignore or add some steps.

I'm primarily doing this to show that it is not impossible to have your own kingdom. You just need time and preparation. I don't kill lords so I', also writing this with that in mind. This is also meant for people that rather fight instead of building up trade. of course its possible to do this by trading if your fiddle around with the steps

Hopefully it helps some of you out there having a rough time and a bad experience with kingdoms, so here are the step :

​

1. Start the game and choose the towns, castles, and spouse you wish to conquer. Yes, do so at this point. Those fiefs are your goals, make sure its not more than four and that they are all adjacent to each other on the map.
2. Ensure that the people in the town and the surrounding villages love you by doing their quests. Do tournaments if you want, but loot yields more money.
3. Start building that army you always wanted. Having an all ranged army is selecting easy mode for the early game.
4. After you got enough money from looting get those caravans rolling and those workshops ready. you only need 2 of each at this point since you are most likely only clan tier 1 or 2. Oh and get married. Bonus points if she's a fighter. You can just taker her army and disband her party!
5. This is where things get spicy. Select a minor faction (or multiple of them) and utterly wipe the floor with them.They are minor factions for a reason, they are below us on the food chain. keep fighting looters until your clan tier is 3 if its not there already
6. Now we fight a kingdom preferably one that isn't hosting your caravan(s) and/or workshop(s). You'll be alone but as masterful Bannerlord players we will only take the fights we know we can win. This will help you farm up that beautiful renown that we love, as well as build up that charm by releasing lords. You handsome fellar!
7. Just win the fights. Send out caravans, utilize workshops (currently a tannery pumps out 600g a day for me on most empire towns) we need that money! IT will help you be wealthy by endgame. Alternately you can invest into smiting or find time for it. But we want to fight that's our top priority.
8. At this point we have spent several in game hours wrecking those inferior AIs (Humanity 1 AI 0). Our clan tier is at the very least 4 and the lords love us and our charm is through the roof. Hooray!!! Now this is where things get even spicier.
9. Now that we have at least 4 workshops and caravans. we are making a minimum of 5k a day. Its time for our Goal! That's right you are strong enough to take that city that you always wanted. after ages of playing out party size can finally hold on to a lot of troops (160). You march towards that town and besiege it! Its easier if you have a lot of prisoners that are willing to join you already. So when you want to sally those walls you can get an extra umph!
10. Thanks to our strategic us of siege weapons and maybe prisoners, we have the town that we wanted! Now, if you don't want to take anything else, beg for peace. You are nothing more than an innocent lonely clan they can't possibly refuse! Bribe them if you must. Also don't hold more than 4 fiefs. You aren't Derhert.
11. Use this time to send out your companions as trusty party leaders they are your army. at clan tier 4 you can have 4 parties. Your wife/Husband, your companions, and you. Your children will have to wait until they grow up to fight alongside you.
12. Spend time as an independent clan to allow your parties to be full, your town to be prosperous, and your villages to be prosperous as well(so they send out huge villager parties and don't get clocked by looter parties). And have a huge garrison protecting your town and castles. Did anyone hear smiting? Oh no that's just the sound of a hammer making you 100k denards per item.
13. Now that all preparations have been taken start your kingdom, select your 4 policies. Canton, Council of Commons, Sacred Majesty, and Noble Retinues are a must then you can select Citizenship and Carter of Liberties later. To help defend yourself.
14. Recruit 50 extra units. Thanks to the policy. Now you have a 200+ party plus the 3 other 100+ parties. You alone can muster an army that's around 550 units. You have towns and castles that are properly garrison(600+ defendants on towns and 450+ for castles! Your town is prosperous and your villagers are so happy they send stacks of people to the local market. Your caravans each bring in 1k to the table and your workshops bring an average of 500 each. Your econ game is strong! Your allies are strong. Your spouse is strong. Your children are strong. We can't forget about our strong horse, or legs (they are an entity on their own).
15. Remember those minor mercenary factions? Well it turns out that after you took their lunch money, gave them black eyes, and stuffed all of them into a locker only to release them afterwards, they gained a new found respect for you. As long as you slowly give them back their lunch money, they will fight for you. Give them time to recruit if you are still at peace. Now you have your own army that will mostly likely go past 1 thousand soldiers.
16. Raise your banner and direct your wrath towards the opposing lords. You yourself carry the one true banner that all lords should follow. Force them to bend their knees! Before you know it, the lords themselves will impose their own wrath on other. Your only job is to ensure that you personally force those sheep to follow you, either by the silver of your sword or the silver of your tongue!

Here are some reasons why these steps help:

- The high numbers of troops in your garrison means that you will most likely not be sieged or looked at by the AI. There are higher priorities for the AI on the map. Since a kingdoms are always a war with 2 or more kingdoms at a time.
- Your caravans and ~~sweatshops~~ workshops should bring enough money to cover the expenses. The fiefs should be the profits or vice versa. But this will make sure that you can barter with lords later on as well, specialty if you partook int he art of using a hammer to smith.
- The time you spent fighting will help build good relations, Ensure that others understand your are honorable (releasing them)and build good relations making it easier to recruit them.
- Those specific policies are important because starting out, you will have a very limited amount of sources from which you can get troops. That applies to your mercenaries and new vassals. The quicker spawning of troops means that notables might be able to raise their tiers faster. You will be the only lord so you need influence as well for when you get new people.
- The policy is also to help you fill up any new fiefs that you get for your lords. The AI will declare war against you if your kingdom has anything juicy for them to take. We all know how fief hungry both Derhert and Mochung are.

Here are some tips:

- Ensure your vassals get the proper amounts of fiefs. IF they don't get what they want they might leave. For example There is no need for a tier 1 clan to have a town or more than 1 castle. There is no reason for a tier 5 to not have at least 1 town and one castle. There is also no need for you to have more than 4 fiefs. I have never ran into any problems with lords mass leaving my kingdom. I can count the number of times a lord has left my kingdom on one hand. (Mercenaries don't count)
- When the time comes and your lords have enough fiefs to match their clan tier but your kingdom takes a fief, always give it to a lord even if they have more than enough. You can always revoke fiefs, but you can't give them away (You can only do so if you have the "Everything has a price" perk)
- Do not ever leave a fief poorly defended. Even if it isn't your own. Stack that baby up. Do not let the AI think that they can take it. Otherwise they will declare war on you.
- Not much of a tip, but i always ensure that lords own fiefs that are adjacent to their own. Its because when it comes to voting for fiefs, the system takes into consideration a few things. Who deserves in regards to clan tier, who's fief is closes to it, and who doesn't have a fief. Its not really that random.
- Lords are what make or break the game. You can rule over all the land alone, but you would have to kill every lord. You can rule over all the land, with the help of those pesky lords.
- Lords love fancy weapons, So if you take up smiting and trade, you can become a menace. Making enough weapons to buy you towns or castles.

Again, I hope that it helps some of you. I was thinking of making it into a video but though others would rather just read it. Don't be too mean in the comments, I'm just trying to help.
