I'm staging a rebellion within Vlandia right now. It took some experimenting to see what worked and what did not. I also wanted to share my campaign story.

**Background**

I had been a vassal of Vlandia for a long time. Vlandia was beginning to steamroll across the map. My armies were playing a pivotal role in many sieges, but Derthert [kept taking fiefs from me](https://i.imgur.com/xyhk3dJ.jpg?2) and my fellow clan leaders who deserved them. I realized too late that he is a coward - unfit to rule a farm let alone a kingdom. So I began plotting against him until my chance finally came.

**Build Relations**

First, I built up 100 relations with a few of the clans within Vlandia. This is easy to do just by using influence in your votes on fiefs. You get -5 or -12 influence for medium and strong votes against someone, but you get around +30 and +80 relations for medium and strong votes in favor of the faction. So you can hand out your votes fairly evenly and still be on everyone's good side. Relations play some role persuation, but I'm not sure how much.

**Sabotage Your Faction**

Now that you have some supporters, you need to weaken the kingdom before you leave it. You won't get far if they keep sending doomstacks at your holdings. So I gathered an army and instigated a war with Khuzait. I did this by starting a raid on one of their border villages. It will kill a few hundred influence points so make sure you have a lot saved up in case you need to keep voting and calling lords to your army. I had hoped that by bringing other lords, the war would last longer after I left the kingdom. My fellow lords were eager to join in because Khuzait had once forayed across the map to fight us in the year prior. But I am a woman of honor and mercy. I stopped the raid as soon as war was declared - it served its purpose. I then took my curious, but energetic generals to Sturgia. The Sturgians were a continuous pain in Vlandia's backside for years and they had inflicted thousands of casualties over several campaigns into our territory. So my fellow lords were just as eager to raid the nearest fishing village and break the fragile peace. But again, I stopped just as war was declared. I then marched south, my generals now confused and worried. I began a raid on the Western Empire, bringing them to war. The map now looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/JlvpQxk.jpg). Satisfied, I took the army to neutral Battania.

**Betray the Kingdom**

I began summoning more lords to my army - leaders of fellow clans. Among them were Calatild of dey Arromac, Belgir of dey Fortes, Servic of dey Valant, and Chason of Neretzes. This took some time as some were hosting armies of their own, or building their forces back up. They sat in the keep quietly and nervously drank their wine. My actions had not gone unnoticed. Vlandia was now under attack by enemies on all sides. I called the lords and lady's attention, [stood before them](https://i.imgur.com/TANYUg1.jpg), and renounced my oaths to Derthert and to Vlandia. I also stated in no uncertain terms that [I would not relinquish my holdings](https://i.imgur.com/T1PUk6G.jpg). Servic gasped. Belgir spat out his wine. Calatild's face contorted in anger. Chason sat unfazed and stared at his hands. I lost 40 relations with every member of Vlandia and was immediately greeted with hostility and threats for my head. They could not attack in the keep - Battania was a neutral state and the guards would not allow harm upon guests within the confines of Marunath's castle. It's all going according to plan.

**Announcing a New Kingdom**

That's when I unveil my secret weapon. Neretze's Dragon Banner. I had been biding my time, researching the battle of Pendraic, and turning over bandit hideouts for the broken pieces. I had assembled them in secret and waited for the time I could stake my rightful claim. I called Arzagos forward (the real reason I brought them to Marunath) and declared the founding of the new Kingdom of Arbor. Since I was now an independent state, the Vlandian lords could not consider me an enemy until a formal declaration of war was made. Peace will be made with all factions upon creating a kingdom, even if you're an outlaw.

**Convince lords to join you**

Each lord sat alone, contemplating what this meant for Calradia. I spoke to Calatild first - she was a close friend and one of the few I actually fought literally side by side with on many occasions. Though she can be coarse and cruel, she was also a caring individual and I still had 60 relations with her after leaving the kingdom. I critical failed the very first persuation attempt. She rejected me offhand, angrily declaring that she would take my head for this betrayal. I then [asked her for a game of MuTorere](https://i.imgur.com/RzAMFh4.jpg). She [wasn't interested](https://i.imgur.com/XL8YAal.jpg). Next, I spoke to Belgir, who now sat at around -4 relations. He almost seemed amused. My persuation attempt went fine, but his was a weak kingdom. He wanted an [offering to show good faith](https://i.imgur.com/BhMm3gW.jpg). He asked for [482,000 denars](https://i.imgur.com/HE4L8Gw.jpg) - nearly half my wealth. Satisfied, he called me ally and continued drinking. Servic could not be convinced. Though he had no care for Derthert or for oaths, he could not forsake his seat for such a slim chance of repayment. Last came Chason. I didn't think I'd convince him. [He was a man of such honor and virtue that it was hard for me to have betrayed his trust.](https://i.imgur.com/aAwx0I8.jpg) Surprisingly, though, he remembered those times I was the only one to vote on his side, and those times I abandoned a herding quest to save him from looters. He required no payment. He would stand by me, good or evil. He took his clan and joined my kingdom.

**Tenuous Peace**

Our armies left the keep in separate ways. We all have preparations to make for the coming storm. I have a few friends in Vlandia I still need to speak to. Vlandia is still dealing with a battle on three fronts, but it won't be long until word of my betrayal reaches Derthert and war is declared between us. Soon all of Calradia will burn for my actions, and a glorious new empire will rise from its ashes.

So if your empire is going too well and you want to toss things up in your game, these are my recommendations:

- In the Kingdom menu, select Policies. Propose policies that will give influence and have a good chance of succeeding.  
    
- Get the Noble Retinues policy. It will increase your party size by 50. Just be aware that when you leave the kingdom, your party size will go back down and your troops will begin to desert.  
    
- You will lose all your accumulated influence after you leave the kingdom, so be ready to build it back up quickly so you can enact policies.
- If you're going to do a betrayal meeting like this, do it in Epicrotea or Marunath where you can forge your kingdom immediately. If you don't, you better be able to wipe out all the lords you brought with you because you can't convince them to join your side until you actually make your kingdom. If you try to leave while they are hostile, they'll all leave at once and jump on you. If you wait, they'll stay in the castle and won't leave until you do.
- The meeting has three purposes. The first and main goal is to get clans on your side as soon as possible before they start wrecking your shit. Only clan leaders can be negotiated with to leave the kingdom, so make sure to summon them and not random other lords. The second is making it so that you won't have to track down every clan leader one at a time after you leave the kingdom. The third is that it takes some of the strongest lords out of the fight against the kingdoms you just declared war on.  
    
- Hoard as much gold as you can. As you can see, some lords need lots of money to be convinced to join you. On this character, I made a vow not to attack villagers or caravans. Instead, I made a million just from selling loot from combat. Always take all the loot. You'll stack up enough horses, mules, and camels to support the weight so it won't slow you down very much.
- I don't really know how traits work, but I'll tell you what I've found. For Generosity, I almost never imprison lords - I just let them go. I also always try to talk people out of combat in poacher and family feud missions. For Valor, I try to fight field battles and sieges with as few troops as I need. Summon a large army for the siege in case enemy reinforcements come, then before you begin the assault, dismiss unnecessary lords from your army. For Honor, I have no idea what I did. Maybe some of those contributed to honor. I lost Mercy at some point, and I don't know why. In any case, these will help convince people to join you.  
    
- I declared war by raiding, declining to fight the peasants, and then attempting to raid again. This time, the peasants won't try to stop you. That way, you don't have to kill peasants if that's not the kind of person you are. You will still lose honor for it, though.  
    
- Technically, there's a little more you can do to sabotage your faction. You could buy up all the food and flood garrisons with peasants and recruited looters. When you siege, they'll be a soft target for breaking through the lines.
