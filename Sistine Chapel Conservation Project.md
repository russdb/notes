### Conservation Project  
1980-1990  
extensive effort  
was an open restoration, so public could see
pope reminded everyone that its for everyone 
took 4 years to paint, restoration took 10  
ceiling was lit with animal fat candles with let of sooty black smoke  
thousands would be used close to the ceiling when choosing a new pope before electricity. this helped to blacken the ceiling. by 80 it was too dark.
even in michs day they had tried cleaning it. put some kind of wax on it to try and help

restoration used the same technique and holes
number of days it took were figured out during resotration. we can now see exactly where the itonaco met each other.  

they tried to keep the plaster on with nails over time. iron nails were temporary but corrosive and the ceiling even leaked, which caused discoloration. 
removed in the restoration campaign, replaced with titanium brackets.  
glue was also used
