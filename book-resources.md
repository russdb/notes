### Book Resources
7/26/21


Here’s a list of ebook and audiobook sources I put together for r/illegallifeprotips yesterday, ~~but apparently it was “too illegal” for them and the mods removed it.~~ it just got restored a few minutes ago by a mod. I figured I’d share them with you guys as well. There’s a list of ebook sites on the FAQ here, but a lot of these aren’t on it. If a mod reads this, perhaps you could update the FAQ to include these?


http://www.mobilism.me for books and audiobooks (my #1 favorite, requires free account to download, it has around 90% of what I look for, including novels, a great collection of cookbooks, magazines, etc).

ebooks channel on IRCHighway for ebooks (my 2nd favorite, has pretty much anything mobilism doesn’t, but requires a free IRC client… [here is a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/2oftbu/guide_the_idiot_proof_guide_to_downloading_ebooks/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) on how you can access it)

http://www.libgen.fun for technical manuals, textbooks, and magazines (my 3rd favorite, also has mirrors with different suffixes like libgen.rs, .is, .lc, .gs, .nl, etc)

http://libgen.rs/fiction/ is the ePub fiction section of libgen (thanks to u/deadnamingmissdaisy for pointing out that libgen has various sections depending on what you’re looking for)

___________________________________________

Also, here are two **honorable mentions**. Legal, but worth a look.

https://archive.org/details/southerncookbook00lustrich/page/34/mode/2up (this one is **legal**. It’s a collection of around 11,500+ scanned cookbooks from the 1700s to today. Most you can view without an account, but the newer/more popular ones require a free account to “check out” the book for an hour… it’s put together by UCLA and some other universities. Just *be warned* that some of the older southern cookbooks have references to “n words”, like at the bottom left of [this page](https://archive.org/details/southerncookbook00lustrich/page/34/mode/2up).. try to remember the time in society in which the books were written when browsing).

http://www.gutenberg.org (thanks to u/katzenpippi, mainly books that are out of copyright. Totally **legal** website).

*On a side note, I use “Calibre” to manage all of my ebooks. It’s free, and can convert from one file type to another, plus it allows sideloading and emailing books to your device.*
