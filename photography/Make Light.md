Professional photographers understand that light is a tool to be wielded, not a circumstance to be endured. When the sun is too harsh, they don't cancel the shoot or wait for clouds. They set up a [scrim](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=photo+scrim&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) or [diffusion panel](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=diffusion+panel&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) to soften the quality of light falling on their subject. When shadows are too deep, they don't accept those shadows as inevitable. They use a [reflector](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=photo+reflector&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) to bounce fill light into the dark areas, or they add a touch of [flash](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=camera+flash&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) to open up the shadows without overpowering the ambient. When the existing light is boring and flat, they don't shrug and shoot boring flat images. They introduce dramatic light of their own creation, using [speedlights](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=speedlight&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) or [strobes](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?q=photo+strobe&BI=6857&KBID=7410&KWID=719969-14596) or even something as simple as a carefully positioned flashlight to add dimension and interest.

This control over illumination means a professional can produce excellent work at any time of day under virtually any conditions. They can create a beautiful portrait at high noon in a parking lot because they brought the tools and knowledge necessary to transform that ugly light into something workable. Meanwhile, the beginner who can only shoot during golden hour is limiting their commercial viability to roughly two hours per day. The professional's understanding of light extends to reading it as well as making it. They see how light falls in a space and immediately understand how to work with it or against it. They know that window light three feet from the glass is softer than window light ten feet away. They understand that a white wall to the left of their subject is effectively a giant reflector. This fluency with illumination, both natural and artificial, is one of the most powerful skills any photographer can develop.
