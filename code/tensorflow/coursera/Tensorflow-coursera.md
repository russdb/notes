## Neural Style Transfer with Tensorflow

https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-style-transfer/ungradedLti/5sCS6/neural-style-transfer-with-tensorflow

first proposed in 2015

uses pretrained model on large data set
works like feature detectors, output of intermediate feature detectors (or layers) and compare that output versus a proposed stylized image
