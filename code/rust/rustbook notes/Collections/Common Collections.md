### [Common #Collections](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch08-00-common-collections.html#common-collections)
##### [the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html)
standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called _collections_.
collections can contain multiple values
data these collections point to is stored on the heap
can grow or shrink as the program runs
Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs

-   A _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
-   A _string_ is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the `String` type previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.
-   A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.
