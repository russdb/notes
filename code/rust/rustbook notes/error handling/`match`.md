### [Matching on Different Errors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#matching-on-different-errors)
What we want to do instead is take different actions for different failure reasons
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error)
            }
        },
    };
}
```
enum `io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io` operation
condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned by `error.kind()` is the `NotFound` variant of the `ErrorKind` enum
`match` expression is very useful but also very much a primitive
more seasoned Rustacean might write this code instead
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", error);
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error);
        }
    });
}
```
doesnâ€™t contain any `match` expressions and is cleaner to read
