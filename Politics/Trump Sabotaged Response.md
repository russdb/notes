In 2009, the Obama-Biden administration launched a $200-million pandemic early-warning program called PREDICT, which trained and supported staff in 60 foreign laboratories to stop and prevent pandemics, including the Wuhan lab that identified Covid19. This initiative identified 1,200 different viruses that had the potential to erupt into pandemics, including more than 160 novel coronaviruses.1

This is the initiative that put a stop to viruses before they became pandemics.2 They warned airports and health agencies. They stop air traffic coming to the US. They initiated contact tracing and identification. They were the ones who stopped pandemics hundreds of times in the past 10 years, and were doing it right up until September 2019.

In September 2019, just as hospitals in Wuhan started filling up due to an unknown disease, the Trump administration ended this $200-million pandemic early-warning program.3 And why not, he also killed the embedded epidemiology field offices.4

Every infectious disease expert immediately raised alarm with Trump's decision. The Washington Post wrote a scathing article saying we're not prepared for a pandemic.5 Biden famously tweeted that Trump's rollbacks left us vulnerable.6

The program, which was just shut down, would have known as early as September 2019 something earth shattering was happening in China's healthcare (Check out satellite images that show hospitals filling up in September 2019).7 This is when our country would have otherwise mobilized. Per protocol, they would have initiated travel advisories, alerted Customs and Border Protection, and traced every person with the virus who was coming to America. This would have cost some money, but it was doable. (Think H1N1 Swine Flu, and how America stopped it from turning into a full blown pandemic though it raged in China...or think H5N1 Avian Flu and how we stopped it though China had to do mass quarantines)

After two months of spread, the first official case was in November in China.8 This was still enough time to prevent spread.

By December 13th, 2019, the first infections started coming to America.9 It was likely here earlier, but remember, this program would have stopped it three months prior.

I am in weekly meetings with Federal Protective Services. Their most popular deployment is Mardi Gras, where dozens of agents all volunteer to go down to protect the event. FPS explained that during Mardi Gras, people were coming into the hospitals with flu-like symptoms, being tested and found negative for flu, and were released into the public where they kept partying.10 The PREDICT program would have put all of the hospitals in America on high alert. Instead, hospitals were releasing people into the public without any warning.

It took four months of Trump calling it a hoax before any public response was made.11

The response was lukewarm at best. As late as August, Trump was doing what he could to hamper testing efforts, claiming it predominantly hurt blue states.12 You recall Kushner refusing assistance to New York by saying "That's their problem".13 (For those who feel raw about this, remember that during the second wave of coronavirus, red states were absolutely obliterated, and far outweighed blue states in new cases and deaths because they refused to acknowledge it was real, and refused to wear masks, some states going so far as to outlaw attempts to wear masks)

Trump rejected 200 MILLION Pfizer vaccine doses in the summer of 20202. In November 2020, after losing the election, he rejected an additional 100 MILLION vaccine doses from Pfizer.14 And of course, Bill Clinton had started the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), and Bush revamped it to include PPE to respond to bio-terrorism and pandemics, and Trump failed to stock up on supplies, then blamed Obama for leaving it empty.

Trump is DIRECTLY responsible for the spread of coronavirus. If he had not shut down the PREDICT program, this would not have happened. I mean, it could be a coincidence that we had no pandemics in the past 10 years, then the very month Trump shut down the program, a pandemic started spreading, but you'd have to be a Trump supporter to believe that.
