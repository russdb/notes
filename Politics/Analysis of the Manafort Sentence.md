Manaforts lawyers tried a few strategies to get the judge to had down a sentence under the recommended 19-24.5 years. Those arguments included

Manafort isn't a "brazen" criminal and has shown remorse and accepted responsibility Mueller filed a 17 page document in which he countered these arguments.

As the Court is aware, the defendant exercised his constitutional right to trial in this matter and contested the facts and his guilt. That alone undermines any reduction for acceptance of responsibility. And, although Manafort subsequently pleaded guilty in the District of Columbia prosecution, he has since breached his plea agreement by making false statements to the government and the grand jury. Also, the feds have had their eyes on Manafort prior to the appointment of a special counsel. Mueller's deputy:

In addition to a lack of remorse, Manafort has his facts wrong: he was being investigated by prosecutors in this district and the Criminal Division There is no evidence of collusion I'm not sure if Mueller argued against this point or not, but this trial wasn't related to collusion and I'm uncertain of arguments saying he shouldn't be held accountable for these crimes because we don't know if he committed additional crimes or not.

Mitigating factors like health concerns (he appeared in a wheelchair) and testimonials of character This is a difficult one because he had testimonials for his character, but there also the leaked text messages between Manaforts daughters discussing what kind of character they believe him to be.

It's kind of difficult to go "nuh uh, he's actually a total dick" in court but these texts seem relevant

"He is a sick f---ing tyrant, And we keep showing up and dancing for him. ... We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing changes." "Don't fool yourself," Andrea wrote to her sister, according to the texts. "That money we have is blood money... You know he has killed people in Ukraine. Manafort is unlikely to commit crimes again Manafort committed crimes while under court supervision. There is zero evidence to support this. Related:

Similar bank/tax fraud cases where defendants received significantly lighter sentences Mueller's deputy again

“Manafort cites a smattering of offshore tax cases from across the country to argue that a lenient sentence is required to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly-situated offenders.

The cited examples, however, are inapposite, as none involves the combination of tax, FBAR, and bank fraud offenses evident in the jury’s guilty verdict here—much less a defendant who continued to engage in deceptive and criminal conduct following indictment and after a guilty verdict and later guilty plea.” As shown here very few if any of these arguments actually hold up to serious scrutiny given Manafort's behavior and crimes. The judge did declare that Manafort would receive no credit for cooperation or acceptance of responsibility. However, there were previous comments suggesting he might rule leniently.

Before taking a recess Ellis mentioned they used to hang pickpockets in England centuries ago Most dramatically Judge Ellis is quoted as admonishing Mueller, saying: “You don’t really care about Mr Manafort’s bank fraud […] What you really care about is what information Mr. Manafort could give you that would reflect on Mr. Trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment.” Which again I feel compelled to comment that Manafort was on the radar for these crimes before the special counsel investigation began. In the end I'm simply not convinced that this short of a sentence makes sense given the nature of Manaforts crimes and the responses to arguments in his favor by the prosecution. This seems to be an extraordinary case, and the lenient punishment doesn't make sense given the circumstances surrounding the defendant.
