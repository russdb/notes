rough notes, william E wallace, phd washington university in St. Louis

ep 15

age of fresco,  

in italian, buon fresco: good fresh  
ancient technique, well preserved from ancient egypt pompei, highly durable becoems part of wall where its painted  
cover first with thick rough plaster called *arriccio*
gives uniform surface, then one day's plaster of thinner surface of smooth plaster called intonaco  

mix as much intonaco as you need for the day, called giornati (for days)
the edge of on intonaco will meet the edge of the other, so we can see how it progressed day to day. quite evident up close.  
rule of thumb 3 days for every major figure, one background, main body, and details of important parts
its a very organized day, basically an 8 hour day.  
intonaco goes on very wet, almost unusable for 2 hours. next 4 hours its just dry enough so that paint dries with plaster. It becomes calcium carbonate. last 2 hours the plaster is too dry and end up painting ahsecco (??) meaning on the dry
each of the pigments has different cheical composition and works slightly differently on the plaster, so experience is needed. need to know the order to paint, etc.  
gettins basic on the wall is through large pieces of paper called cartoons. 
exactly the size it is painted. the outlines of the figures are pricked with small holes and hit with a ball of dust which leaves the dotted outline on the wall.  
so painter has both the cartoon and its dotted transfer on ceiling 
very complicated process requires lots of hands  
plaster needs to be right consistency  
someone to prick cartoons, done night before 
mixing pigments, taking care of brushes, etc 
someone to hold up cartoons
surprising that mich was as expert as he was.. never painted frescoe before  
he become so adept and learned so quick at xferring cartoons that at the end of process he wasn't using the cartoons and when he did he skipped the transferring part and used a knife instead on the wall, ripping the cartoons  
done on the surface of highly irregular ceiling
vaults were not made nice and smooth originally  
conservation happened 1980-1990
was an open restoration, so public could see
pope reminded everyone that its for everyone 
took 4 years to paint, restoration took 10  
ceiling was lit with animal fat candles with let of sooty black smoke  
thousands would be used close to the ceiling when choosing a new pope before electricity. this helped to blacken the ceiling. by 80 it was too dark.
even in michs day they had tried cleaning it. put some kind of wax on it to try and help

scaffold bridge is what mich built to get close
holes in side of the ceiling to help hold and move the bridge down the chapel as he worked. previously thought scaffold came from floor, but this is wrong. restoration used the same technique and holes
number of days it took were figured out during resotration. we can now see exactly where the itonaco met each other. 
prophet zacharia is a good example.
painted in pieces, with over 300 bodieso on the ceiling. 
prophets and sibyl very large on a curved wall, some are 14 feet high
they tried to keep the plaster on with nails over time. iron nails were temporary but corrosive and the ceiling even leaked, which caused discoloration. 
removed in the restoration campaign, replaced with titanium brackets.  
glue was also used 

how to look and engage at the ceiling. 
genesis in the narrative spawn 
series of 9 narratives, but its generally discontinuous, but that could be encouraged by mich 
first 9 versus of genisi, but not everything, no cain and able. 
3 scenes of noah, 3 scenes of adam and eve, 3 scenes of god creating the earth 
small then large then small then large. 5 small narratives, 4 larges ones  
in reverse order, doesn't start at genesis, starts with drunkeness of noah.  
from noah to seperation of light and dark 
movement from sin to salvation
analogy from present sinful state to a holy state at the alter 
look at it in this mannger.  
kind of artificial to impose order though.
try and see it from 3 or 4 view points to get a feeling for richness and density of what mich embedded
each scene part of a larger ensemble
between first large scene to the end the figures become larger. partly because mich began work in reverse order. flood created before sun and moon. 
halfway done, he realized the some of the figures were too small, so he decided to make them bigger.  
implied simplicity as we move back to the beginning where there is only god  
mich removed most of the painting assistants towards the end
in flood scene we are the spectator in foreground on isolated island 
helps to feel their panic as they try and escape the waters  
ark is in the background, large squarish boat which is what they thought it looked like. 
notice the transparent on the leg of guy trying to get into the boat, and good feat for fresco.
tree arches over the painting, the branch points to the white dove in the window of the ark. 
mich had seen others paint this scene, the flood by paolo uccello
paolo has one figure who is looking to god, and mich did the same thing! pretty cool!! in the middle of this fresco, a father is trying to save his son

ep 16

temptation and expulsion narrative
mich has already done something interesting ith the composition with the it being half and half divided by tree of knowledge. follow the tail and ou will find out it has two tails. implies a figure of evil. two sides of the same picture, kind ofa  medieval idea showing the before and after in the same scene. note that landscape serves the purpose of being important. the tree extends over the garden making one feel like sitting in the shady, where as the consequnce is bleak and barren 
in the garden there isa  dead branch, a premonition, or foreshadowing. show dont tell right? the branch echos what will happen. eve has a peculiar bodily position.  
scene has been represented many times.
eve is being tempted by the serpant, while adam is picking fruit from the tree of knowledge. implies both are at fault as opposed to previous artworks which blames the female alone.
the pose of the two figures before eve was tempted.. very promiscuous. 
seems to be a physical intamacy, such as a sexual encounter. suggestion of fellatio? 
for us to recognize this and be uncomftorable means we share the shame of it as well since we live after these events. reminds us we have suffered the lack of the grace of god. 
on right side, mich takes inspiration from massaccio's expulsion of adam and eve, 1425
mich uses similar angel, but michs is much better.
michs expulsion is more foreful and interactio than massacio's.
mich makes us aware of the shame by cringing away from the sword. less wrestling match, more realizing what they have done.
in left side, eve seems young and free of blemish, but on right side eve has apprently aged.

next scene is a small narrative,called creation of even, enclosed with decoration and distractions around it, but its the very central scene in the entire chapel. in the very middle of the 9 genesis.
in the past, this area would divide the court between the priests and the pope. 
uses landscape effectively again. god calls eve forth with commanding. adam partly embraces the tree. tree kind of mirrors eve. the cut tree is kind of foreshadowing. 
scene has been represented many times in history.
eve seems to step forth from adam.
see the negative space between eves hand and gods arm.
power in the sense of the gesture to god the father

creation of adam scene
perhaps the most famous.  
try and pretend that you havent seen it before. 
genesis is a laconic description which doesnt allow one to visualize it. now we envision it in michs eyes.
seems like a two figure composition with adam on left, and god on right. 
god is kind of obscured by being enclosed in a lilac cloak so he is larger than life, which lets people focus kind of on adam.
its not a two figure composition. in the cloak is a host of figures that seem to be mostly angels without wings.
they help suppot god in his flight, to help buoy him up in a sort of invention of flying god.
in the middle is a virginal woman who looks longingly at adam, is it eve?
could be the virgin mary?
follow gods arm around, and its pointing and encasing a baby, is it jesus?
is it the geneology?
its like we are seeing his mind in active work.
the cloack kind of looks like the cross section of a human brain, which is a curious suggestion but doubtful think mich new the anatomy, but maybe?!
some previous illustations of adam, such as monreale creation of adam.
jacopo della uercia creation of adam, taught mich. 
mich goes far beyond with the idea and execution.
god is flying in incredibly active and energetic manner. opposed to the others
michs has a dynamic motion, where the heck did this idea come from?
botticelli birth of venus shows a kind of wind god, is this where mich got the idea?
adam reclines on the earth, god made man from mud and the landscape moves from mud to blue of the sky. like life is coming from mud 
he is physically beautiful, but has no soul or thoughts of his own, its the nano second right before he is given spirit. perhaps the most incredible seperation in the whole of art history, less than two inches from adams finger to gods finger. easily seen from the floor 
dionysus, from the east pidement of parthenon, c 438-432bce, notice the pose compared to adam.
mich had never been to greece though, so this is fairly remarkable from a civil perspective. 
just the image of rhe two hands tells the entire story. easy to tell which is the passive and which is the active hand giving life.
its one of the largest scenes, and everyone is drawn to it. preeminent vision of deity and the creation
in a god like manner, mich has morphed an image of creation for all of western christendom. we imagine it in his terms.
let us disabuse the myth that he imaged the face of god as julius the 2nd.
they dont look that close
it would be impossible, the pope for his megolamania he would not approve of being god himself.
more suggestive and interesting, that is looks more like moses from his sculptures but dont looks exact. seems like mich can come up with these amazing faces and such on his own.

next large scene is creation of the sun and moon.
god hurtles towards the view in a coming and going. On the right he is approaching, on left he disappears while going to create. he simply points to create things. Angels are again carrying him.
see creation of stars, artist unknown, monreale cathedral, sicily
god is kind of in an awkward pose, but appears mid flight
notice more negative space between angels hand gods foot.
centimeters or inch than less.
this is a first in the history of art, the energy is asonishing. the view is als amazing. we get to see gods face and ass!  
we see the buttocks and bare feet of god!!!
could be from the bible, exodus 33
the lord said to moses i will do the very thing you ask for you have found favor in my sight and i know you by name. moses said show me your glory i pray and he said i will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim the name before you the lord and i will be gracious to whom i will be gracious..
you cannot see my face, for no one shall see me and live. and the lord continues, you shall stand on the rock 
however, mich shows the face. we are permitted to look in the face.
plus second commandment to not make graven images of god.
sort of impressive, visual equivalent of omnipresence and omnipotence.

last scene is seperation of light and dark.
here god is a whirling dervish
important moment in history of ceiling. towards the celing jonah looks ahead at the enrgy of god. in a difficult pose.


part 17
jonah is directly over the alter who looks in astonishment at god.
jonah was wallowed by whale which is represented, was in there for 3 days so is a preconfiguration of christ.pointing fingers direct attention down to a corner.
spandrel is a squared triangular surface at the corners of the chapel.
4 of them represent triumph over opporession by the jews in the old testament. one from book of esther. complicated narrative *punishment of haman*
mich does this intelligently.
one of the last scenes painted, so level of sophistication is very high. skill is great
mordachai at the kings gate, and this guy saved the kings life.
king ahu in bed wondering if he ever rewarded mordachai when he realized he hadnt.
next panel is the banquet where his wife is warning ahu that an enemy of mordachai is at the banquet. and ahu wants relief for her people and make haman pay, so haman is crucified on a tree limb. peculiar and complicated story for a ceiling
however, the story is told disjointedly in the spandrel  
what comes first is on the riht, second on the left, last is the most prominent in the middle. so mich has to decide what is most important to tell in the story in just one panel.
bible says haman was hanged, but mich choses crucible on wood, like jesus on the altar below. every part of the chapel is being connected at the head alter. ties ceiling and other parts ot he building together. kind of a topological configuration.
takes crucifixion and makes it a victory for jesus.

next spandrel
one of the first was another spandrel, one is a young david triumphing over goliath.
very difficult curved surface. violent action takes place in a convincing manner, buts it more simple than the one of mordachai.
like everything else in his life, he masters it.

prophets and sibyls.
figures from old testament and antiquity. jonah is one of the old testament prophets, he joined by 5 sibyls, female seers of pagan antiquity.
large male and female alternating figures are accompanied by two genas (??) who are like invisible thoughts. they assist the sibyls and prophets in there work and thinking and such. mich created a race of beings full of wisdom.

erythaean sibyl
turns a page of weighty tome while her genuis blows on a flame of a hanging lamp over head. the flame is akind of light an dturht while its analogue to whats going on in her head. like a light bulb??  
size and stature of figure, we can almost read her book, we can see the letter Q as the beginning. qua? qui? latin interrogatives start with q, latin would have been the language associated with the sibyl
the gown is perfect.

delphic sibyl
naval of the earth, delphi greece. considered to be the center of the world in ani
most comely, preistess and greek maiding. startled sideways g lance, like she can see the narrative unfold on her scroll. her sight in insight full of spiritual illumination. there are helpers in the back doing stuff. how can mich be accused insensitivity to the female form (gee i wonder why..)

propher tdaniel. 
works with a large book that is help up by a small genuis on his shoulders. 
notice how many of the prohets reading and writing? Making people aware of the knowledge in books. yet we require no book the read the ceiling since everything is so visible and comprehensible. show dont tell, right? 

Cumaean sibyl
cuma is sight most important sibyl in italy. a cave is there where the sibyl sat and made utterances. mich probably knew of this place, how would he imagine it?  
she is a large strong figure. looks as though she is making forceful utterances and is far away from the idea of beauty, like a cave person would be. we know we are in the presence of more than human.
fearsome aspect with the mountainous shoulders and breasts and left arm.
suggests a great antiquity, like she has been there forever. aged in millenia.
masculanized upper body but lower body is more female. look at the feet and posture.
strange and unexpected fusion of genders, renders her larger than life, such as male and femal. encompasses all things, all of humanity.

libyan sibyl
one of the most beatufil of the figures. captures her in the midst of uncomfy contortion while picking up aheavy tome. she is very pretty but still has masculanized body. but this could have been a way of praising the women to be described in masculine terms.
see *studies for the libyan sibyl* (recto) by mich, 1508-12, red chalk, metropolitan museum of art, nyc
he is probably working from a male model in that and transorms into a female.
the entire figure turns on the toe, and mich practices this three times on the page before its exactly right. such a tiny detail but makes a huge difference in perception by the viewer.
the left hand is redrawn as well. first time is not what he wanted.
mich signature is on there, but added much later as mich signs no drawings but collectors would do that when we didnt value them as much as we do now.
we see mich scribbling also, but its called a para, which is a mark of a collector to authenticate something.
this isa  very small drawing, which he then enlarged greatly.
the drapery is amazing.
see fortitude by sandro botticelli 1470.
galleria degli uffizi, florence
compare the poses and liveliness, botticellis seems conservative and uninteresting.
the pose suggests she is in the act of making prophetic utterances and doing important things. no sense of that in others such as botticelli.

ignudii 
overlapping the sibyls and prophets are twenty  young nudes
we tend to see what we want and many people miss these, which is the amazing ability of mich let people focus on what we want without distraction.
these are down the ladder on signifigance. 
on separation of light and dark, there are four of them in the corners
they encroach the important scene in the middle 
how are these explained? 
perhaps they are from an anticedent time from the genesis times. between narrative and decoration. between pagan and christian worlds?  between flesh and spriti. they are the sculputral components compared the painted components. kind of serve as three dimensional forms for the painted narratives.  
like animated sculptures, the ignudii are like the geni for the prophets and sibyls. indeterminate in meaning. in every manner and appear comfy, but the poses are utterly impossible. is a fun assignment to try them out, try and memorize and recreate.
mich is not trying to copy natural poses, but they seem believable.
they are not, they are actually kind of disturbing poses.
like they are bound, beautiful but impossible to understand. 
relaxed with impossible contortions. painted reconstructions of ancient marbles. he invented a repetoire of poses. 
see 
## *Torso bellvedere*
Artist unknown, 1st century BCE, marble. H. Vatican Museums, Vatican City, Rome.
looks like a lot of the ignudiis. 
the mich scholar  howard hiberts says ignudii are twenty different reconstructions of the torso bellvedere
seems like mich like it battered so he could do what he wanted with it in his mind
look at the way mich goes from the torso to the what the ignudiis are doing, they seem alive compared to the torso!  

munets? 
sequence o nthe flat part of the wall that goes to the ceiling.  
shows the line of christ from gensis to prophets and sibyl to frescos below
the whole chapels serves as geneology from the beginning time down to the pope, the current representative of god on earth.
mich painted them rapidly in two or three days with cartoons, by now he was relaly good. these were the last parts he did.
these areas have the contraluce effect, or against the light.
when light is coming in from windows it is hard to see the pictures on the surface. 
he made it bold and colorful on purpose.
after cleaning, much discussion on surprising use of color.
it was kind of a shock for people. 
so cool, right?  
helps to assist in the meaning of chapel and things in the distance.

the ceiling is a compendium of the renaissance and theology. greco roman is combined with the hebrew world, pagan and christian side by side. its a work of genuis that cannot be exhausted through talking and examining. besare called it the lamp of our art.

was unveiled all saints day nov 1 1512. mich was laconic when he wrot about. I have finished the chapel I have been painting, the pope is very well satisfied.
