### What Are The Curve Wars

#### 1
Two things make the DeFi world go round: • Liquidity • Incentives Protocols want liquidity, and we want incentives. We say we're in it for the tech, but we're also greedy. Protocols understand this. They fight for our liquidity, incentivizing us with creative rewards.  

### 2  
what is [@CurveFinance](https://twitter.com/CurveFinance)?  
  
Curve is a decentralized exchange #DEX made possible through automated market-making #AMM.  
  
It's like #Uniswap or #Sushiswap, but started out only accommodating liquidity pools of similarly behaving assets (mostly stablecoins).   

### 3 
What sets Curve apart from other DEXs?  
  
• Low trading fees  
• Low slippage  
• Composability  
• [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) token rewards  
  
How?  
  
Their "StableSwap" mechanism allows for efficient stablecoin swaps, especially for whales. The math is heavy - dig into their whitepaper for more on that.

### 4 
Liquidity providers of a trading pool earn a share of the trading fees on that pool, as well as Curve governance token ([$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click)) rewards.  
  
Two incentives.  
  
These are differentiated between a 'Base' and 'Rewards' APY.

### 5 
You'll notice that the 'token rewards APY' has a range. That's where their veCRV model comes in.  
  
Vote-Escrowed CRV ( #veCRV ) is earned by locking your [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) tokens for 1-4 years.  
  
Longer lock = more veCRV  
  
veCRV earns 50% of exchange fees (other 50% to LPs) for a 7.16% APY:  

![[Pasted image 20220508031057.png]]

### 6 
On top of the 7.16% holder APY, those with veCRV also get higher rewards in the Curve pools.  
  
Recall that each pool had a reward range. As you lock more [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) for veCRV, you unlock higher rewards.  
  
Example: Accumulate veCRV to go from 3.21% to 8.02% APR on the 'tricrypto2' pool.  

### 7
This cycle is brilliant #tokenomics. Curve is regularly emitting [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) tokens, but participants lock up their rewards for YEARS to get increased yield rates.  
  
The incentivizes aren't over. This next one is big. It's what started the Curve wars.  
  
It's the "vote" in veCRV...  

### 8 
veCRV holders vote on which pools CRV rewards are allocated to. More votes = more CRV rewards = more stakers = more liquidity veCRV is powerful.  

With an ecosystem as large as Curve, it influences the liquidity of the biggest stablecoins. 

Welcome to The Curve Wars...  

### 9 
You have stablecoin protocols looking to control as much veCRV as possible. They just want liquidity. + Protocols like Convex , Votium, and Llama Airforce Union that offer additional incentives & conveniences to get control of veCRV. They jumped in to benefit from the game.  

###  10
[@ConvexFinance](https://twitter.com/ConvexFinance) is the biggest. It controls over 50% of the total supply of [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click).  
  
Some now call it "The Convex Wars". In reality, they've just become the battleground.  
  
Convex rose to power as a yield aggregator.  
  
They allowed Curve LP providers a cheaper way to get maximum APY.  

### 11  
On Curve, staking pool rewards are increased as you lock more [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click).  
  
Oftentimes, you need more $ in CRV tokens than the value of your LP deposit to get max rewards.  
  
Convex solved this by aggregating people's veCRV and unlocking max yield without needing all the veCRV yourself.  

### 12 
On top of that, you're rewarded with Convex's native token, [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click).  
  
Convex also launched their version of locked CRV tokens, called cvxCRV. You deposit [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click) into Convex, they lock it for #veCRV, and you get #cvxCRV out.  
  
You can #stake the cvxCRV for rewards, and exchange it anytime.  

### 13  
Right now, staking your cvxCRV yields a total reward of 43.82%. Compare that to ~7% for your veCRV with a 1-4 year lockup. Guess where this is going... Similar to Curve, owning & locking CVX allows you to direct how Convex uses its veCRV votes. So many tokens, let's recap:

### 14
Acquiring [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) is now more attractive than [$CRV](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CRV&src=cashtag_click).  
  
You're a new stablecoin protocol. You need liquidity, and therefore need to control as much veCRV as possible. You can:  
  
• Buy & lock [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) tokens and vote for your pool  
• Bribe others who have vlCVX to vote for your pool  

### 15 
Bribing vlCVX holders is cheaper than accumulating CVX tokens.  
  
In the last round (week of Mar 3), protocols paid [$0](https://twitter.com/search?q=%240&src=cashtag_click).36 per [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) vote. Compare that to the cost of buying one [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click), currently [$17](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2417&src=cashtag_click).  
  
Protocols are paying vlCVX holders to direct CRV rewards to their liquidity pools.  

### 16 
Holders of locked [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) make out well too. Convex estimates a 57% APY when including incentives (bribes).  
  
As a vlCVX holder, you have the option of manually voting for LPs to earn bribes  
  
OR  
  
You can delegate your votes to a protocol that will do it automatically. Enter #Votium.  

### 17  
[@VotiumProtocol](https://twitter.com/VotiumProtocol) chooses the best bribes to maximize your rewards for a voting round.  
  
You delegate vlCVX to them, sit back, and enjoy the rewards.  
  
Votium doesn't currently have a native token. We'll see how long that lasts.  
  
One problem with the protocol though...  

### 18  
You're rewarded in whatever tokens were voted for. This can mean small amounts of several coins that aren't worth paying gas to claim. But with every problem comes a protocol quick to solve it! The Llama Airforce Union (LAU) was born to pool Votium rewards into a single asset.  

### 19 
The LAU will consolidate the bribe rewards into auto-compounding cvxCRV for you to claim anytime. Okay, we've gone pretty deep down the chain of protocols involved in the Curve wars. Let's stop there and recap the best ways for YOU to benefit from this ongoing battle.  

### 20 
Top-earning strategies:  
  
1. Stake cvxCRV for a 43.8% APY. No lockup period.  
2. Lock [$CVX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CVX&src=cashtag_click) for vlCVX. Manually vote on the best bribes for 57% APY.  
3. Delegate vlCVX to Votium to earn max bribe rewards.  
4. Join the LAU to consolidate & auto-compound Votium rewards.
