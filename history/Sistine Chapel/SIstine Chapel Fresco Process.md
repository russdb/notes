### Fresco Process

Highly durable process by where the [[fresco]] becomes part of the wall itself. Each each of the pigments has different cheical composition and works slightly differently on the plaster, so experience is needed. need to know the order to paint, etc.  
ancient technique with well preserved frescos from [[ancient egypt]] and [{pompeii}].
very organized day, basically an 8 hour day.  

#### step 1
cover first with thick rough plaster called *[[arriccio]]*
gives uniform surface, 

#### step 2  
then one day's work worth of thinner surface of smooth plaster called *[[intonaco]]*   
mix as much intonaco as you need for the day, called giornati (for days)  
the edge of on intonaco will meet the edge of the other, so we can see how it progressed day to day. quite evident up close.  
rule of thumb 3 days for every major figure, 
* one background
*  main body
*  details & important parts  

#### standard day
intonaco goes on very wet, almost unusable for 2 hours.  Only underpainting  
next 4 hours its just dry enough so that paint dries with plaster.  
	It becomes calcium carbonate  
 last 2 hours the plaster is too dry and end up painting ahsecco (??) meaning on the dry  

from there the [[Sistine Chapel Cartoons]] are applied

plaster needs to be right consistency  
someone to prick cartoons, done night before 
mixing pigments, taking care of brushes, etc 
someone to hold up cartoons
