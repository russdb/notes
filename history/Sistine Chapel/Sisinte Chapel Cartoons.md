very complicated process requires lots of hands  

#### Process  

exactly the size it is painted. the outlines of the figures are pricked with small holes and hit with a ball of dust which leaves the dotted outline on the wall.  
so painter has both the cartoon and its dotted transfer on ceiling 
very complicated process requires lots of hands  

he become so adept and learned so quick at xferring cartoons that at the end of process he wasn't using the cartoons and when he did he skipped the transferring part and used a knife instead on the wall, ripping the cartoons   

done on the surface of highly irregular ceiling
