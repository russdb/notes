Sorry for the delayed response. Yes, there are actually a lot of really cool Crusades-esque books for you!

Brian Catlos, Infidel Kings and Holy Warriors - "the Crusades" as full-scale European/Mediterranean war, from Spain to the Baltic to Jerusalem; uses individual case studies Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades and The First Crusade - nice, readable, fairly traditional books on the mentioned topics. Asbridge is my personal favorite intro-to-Jerusalemish-Crusades author Jonathan Riley-Smith: The Crusades: A History - another really excellent and accessible intro, from one of the top scholars in the field. It's also rather shorter than Asbridge's overall book and MUCH shorter than the other option (Tyreman's God's War) Christopher Tyreman, How to Plan a Crusade - This is a little bit less accessible, but its focus on food, money, logistics might help more with the "average person" focus The two from the Muslim perspective would probably be Paul Cobb, Race for Paradise; and Amin Maalouf, The Crusades Through Arab Eyes. The first is more traditionally a history book; the second is a retelling of episodes from some of the Arabic Crusades-era chronicles (since the style of actual medieval chronicles can be odd, off-putting, and really frakking boring to people who aren't used to it, hehe). I hope this gives you something to latch onto! :)
