'It's complicated.'

There are a few different ways to approach this question.

**Textual accounts**

The first, and the method longest favored, has been to trust the written sources. These include Gildas' sermon, Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and other later texts. Each tells a slightly different version of the arrival, in boats, of Saxon mercenaries who turn on the hapless Britains, conquering and/or enslaving and/or driving them from England into the hills of Wales.

These texts are no longer trusted, however. Why? First, scholars have done a lot of legwork to track down Bede's sources, and it's very clear that Bede based his account of the Anglo-Saxon arrival directly on Gildas. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (which, remember, was written 400 years after these events) gives no indication of having any other unique sources either. Hence, these are not actually three separate accounts that agree, but one story, repeated two additional times. If we read Gildas, we're on the same footing as Bede.

So what happens when we read Gildas? Late Antique historians have, for the past 30 years, done a lot of really good work studying the genre and literary function of ancient and early medieval texts. What I mean by this is that we've come to recognize that ancient texts weren't written by people who necessarily were interested in telling the same kinds of stories we assume they are. A modern historian would, for instance, be interested in knowing precisely what people did, and how these actions influenced the events that followed. Late Antique authors, however, were often much more interested in how people's actions communicated their *moral* virtue, and hence tend to write stories where our ability to understand whether someone was good or bad is privileged over strict attention to causality. The author of the Historia Augusta doesn't tell us about Elagabalus' kinky sex life so we know *why* he was assassinated; he tells us about it so we know that the emperor *deserved what he got*. The things that authors emphasize vary by genre, by the author's context, by the objectives of the piece they were writing -- lots of factors. So just as a good literary scholar much think hard about how to distill meaning from a work of fiction, we must approach our historical texts with great care if we want to know what they're really on about.

Gildas wrote a sermon, and the central theme is about the consequences of rebellion against God. He uses examples from the scriptures to warn of the consequences of sin, goes through a list of corruption practiced by five bad contemporary kings, criticized the contemporary church, and calls his listeners / readers to repent. He also uses a long example from history to set this up, and this comes at the beginning of the sermon. It's easy to read this example from history as an objective account, but we have to remember that it's actually an introduction meant to get us to the real issue Gildas cares about, which is the consequences of rebelling against God.

In this historical story, Gildas rattles off the history of Britain, and he frames it as a sequence of rebellion vs submission. The Britons were weak by themselves, but Rome conquered them and made them strong. They rebelled, which made them weak, but the Romans conquered them again and this was actually good because submission to Rome made them strong. Then the Romans gave them Christianity, and they got even stronger. But they rebelled *twice*: against the Romans (by sending a usurper, Magnus Maximus, to the Continent with their armies), and against God (by embracing the Pelagian heresy). And that made them weak.

This is where we get to the part that historians of the Anglo-Saxon conquest care about. Britain was being raided in the fifth century, and they asked for help -- Rome sent it, they were saved, but then the Romans left because the soldiers were needed elsewhere. Before they left, the Romans built a wall in the north (Hadrian's Wall?? Only, that was built 300 year earlier). Britain was raided a second time -- the Roman army came and saved them again, building another wall (the Antonine Wall? Again, the chronology is way off -- but ok). A third time, Britain called for aid -- and Rome was fighting off the Huns and could spare no men. So the British asked for Saxon mercenaries, and they came, and they stayed. Shortly thereafter, these mercenaries were burning down Romano-British towns, killing their inhabitants, and Britain was ruined. But GOD sent the last Roman, Ambrosius, who beat the Saxons at Badon Hill. The moral? Britain never should have rebelled in the first place. But GOD *will* help you get back on the right path after you've sinned. So repent now, before it's too late!

So -- what do we do with this as a historical document? It's actually very vague on details. There's no mention of Hengist or Horsa, the two brothers (both named 'horse') who supposedly led the Saxon mercenaries. Gildas, in fact, is talking about events as though he expects his audience to already know what's going on. And he's clearly embroidering the story to make it work for his story, adding dramatic elements like the construction of Hadrian's Wall in the fifth century to make the narrative more compelling. His real goal isn't to tell us what happened; it's to get his kings to repent and turn back to God. But there are some details lurking in the text that are probably true. So let's leave Gildas with a ?, and look at the next source of evidence.
