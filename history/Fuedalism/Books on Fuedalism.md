OP's question also largely depends on which area and period OP and/ or OP's professors are specialized in the Middle Ages.

If OP by change has not read through [Little & Rosenwein eds. 1998], they should at least check those articles by Brown, Bonnassie & Althoff and so on in the part II (pp. 107-210), with a very short and convenient historiographical introduction. Essentially, at least in academic understanding, 'feudalism' and 'feudal society' had been summed up to the works of two French historians, Bloch and Duby, in cases of Central France (Mâcon) in the 11th century. This historiographical debates also concern how we regard the 11th century Mâcon as a representative of whole medieval society (Bonnassie will be a really good starting point to the recent shift of focus onto southern France - northern Iberia to find a social bond (allegedly understood as 'feudal') around the turn of the millennium.

If OP can also read German, [Patzold 2012], one of Wissen series from Academic publisher Beck, will offers alternative and more steam-lined overview. Generally speaking, German historians have most eagerly adapted Reynolds' view of constructed feudalism based on high and later (and further later) medieval legal culture, and developed further in their own field of research (Dendorfer & Deutinger hrsg. 2010; Spiess hrsg. 2013). Their shared minimum consensus was the feudo-vassalic bond as a legal came north to Alps first in the 12th century. If you have difficulty in German, introduction of [Roach 2012] might have a brief mention to the recent trend of German histriography.

On the other hand, a series of historians since 1990s, such as Bisson, White and Reuter, have discussed how the concept of public order/ royal authority was functioned, or absent from the 11th century Europe, in contrast to the earlier classic understanding of feudal society by Duby and others. 'feudal revolution' debates in the journal Past & Present in the middle of the 1990s was their main field of historiographical debates. Now [Fourace 2020] summarizes their discussion, but you can also check their papers directly via JSTOR or other e-journal if you affiliate with academic institution.

One thing I would consider doing is looking through [/u/idjet](https://old.reddit.com/u/idjet) ’s old posts. He’s no longer active on this sub, but this was his exact research topic. In several of his answers, he summarized the debates with reference to the revisionists.
