> Can you unpack any of those, or provide examples of rulers who filled those rules who we'd normally think of as "feudal kings"?



The (possibly) best example would be no other than historian's changing understanding of how Charlemagne [and his successors of the Carolingian Franks as well] would "rule" his subject in the kingdom.

While the classical studies on the Franks and feudalism like that of Ganshof (still extensively cited in Wikipedia's entry of Charlemagne) focus on the institutional aspects of his government, such as the military obligation, royal delegates (_missi dominici_), and the recruitment of clergy to commission written business, the newer study focus rather on more ideological sides of his (and his successor's) rulership that they wish to have the elites of the kingdom in common.

If we look at Charlemagne's _Admonitio generalis_ (General Admonition: 794), addressed both to the secular and ecclesiastical elites, we'll find that both the prologue and the text itself repeatedly convoke the images as well as names of the ruler/ leaders of the Israelites in OT. Recent studies interprets this important source of Charlemagne's government not primarily as a counterpart of the modern legislation, but rather as a kind of religious-moral guideline, "corrections" (_correctio_ in Latin), a counterpart of OT's Mosaic Law.

The kingdom of Carolingian Franks is sometimes referred to as "the church (_ecclesia_ in Latin)". It also means that the people of the kingdom, "the Franks" could be defined as the congregation, Christian community of this church. Instead of their traditional diverse law and customs, various groups of people were now re-defined as the Franks with the "correct" Christian beliefs. Their leader, Charlemagne, should have in turn been regarded as a key figure that mediated the God and the Godly chosen Franks for the prosperity of the kingdom, just as David and Joshua (mentioned repeatedly in _Admonitio generalis_) played their role in OT. De Jong argues that this kind of the synthesis of the church and the "state" deepened further in course of the early 9th century, under the reign of Charlemagne's son, Louis the Pious who also was known to have practiced the public penance (De Jong 2009). Thus, motivations of the Carolingians behind the military conquest and Christianization went hand in hand, and politico-religious ideology was often manifested in form of symbolic rituals. They also played an important role in the political culture in early medieval Europe.

Some recent studies also remark that not only the clergy, but also lay elites of the Carolingian Franks were more receptive of such idea of political theology as well as the literacy in general than previously assumed. The classical dichotomy model between the secular and lay aristocrats is no longer largely tenable - bishops were also mainly drawn from the aristocratic milieu (and consecrated after their education in the chapel at the royal court or the cathedral school attached it).

In this context, both secular and ecclesiastical (episcopal and abbot's) offices were not so expected to be so functional, but the ruler often made use of them as tokens with the elite (aristocrat) family to barter their friendships (Cf. Reuter 2006 (1982); Schieffer 1989).

The transfer of the land prior to the 12th century, previously interpreted as "fief", also should be considered within this context. The land was certainly sometimes bartered between the ruler and the elite, but it does often apparently functioned just a token of their relationship, and in most cases, the surroundings of the land transfer (especially with which exact conditions/ obligations attached to it) are unclear. As Reynolds point out, there is almost no evidence of the "institutional" mass-scale, uniform grant of the land from the ruler to their followers under the Carolingian Franks.

From these analyses, I suppose that it is not so appropriate to define the basic political-social relationship under the Carolingian Franks as "feudal", primarily defined by exchanges of the land and attached obligations between the ruler and the subject.
