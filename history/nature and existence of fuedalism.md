While more can always be said, I also summarized a very brief histriographical development of a few individual areas after Reynolds before in, together with some essential readings: [IAmA Postgrad who would like to learn more about modern debates on feudalism - what books should I read to get the quickest and most comprehensive overview?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/p6arly/iama_postgrad_who_would_like_to_learn_more_about/)

In the linked thread, my summary points out a few recent (though since 1970s) issues at stake, often tied with the notorious feudalism debate.

- The classical model of feudalism as well as "feudal society (especially in the middle of the 20th century), focused on Central France in the 11th century. Is Central France appropriate region to apply its political and social model further to the whole Europe, or the whole Middle Ages?  
    
- Recent German scholarship have tended to emphasize the context of re-defined feudalism within the development of written law culture in the High Middle Ages (especially in course of the 12th century).
- While my recommendation will attract some serious dislike from non-specialists, a few classic concept of "public authority" or "the public order", and the expectation to the possible rule of the ruler tied to these concepts and their changes should also be taken into re-consideration, as the "feudal revolution" (or mutation) debates in the end of the 20th century suggested. Alternatively, then how did the ruler "rule" the kingdom, or stabilize their position within society of the kingdom especially in the earlier Middle Ages?

> Have any frameworks been developed?

Rather than the simple dichotomy of existence/ absence of the feudalism as a fundamental politico-social relation, the avoidance of feudalism by medieval historians in general should also be seen from their recent preference of more nuanced and fluid (rapidly changing) images of European society within the classical periodization of the "Middle Ages." "Feudal"/ "Feudalism" had often been employed to denote the stagnation throughout the whole Middle Ages for too long, and also been haunted by too many prejudices as well as definitions.

Especially as for the Early Middle Ages, some alternative concepts like the friendship, the arbitrator in conflict solutions, or theocratic rulership can instead perhaps be used to define the excepted role of the ruler, but they seem not to attract enough attention especially from non-specialists.
