These books were massive enterprises and are designed to be introductions to early career scholars and provide a roadmap for research. Many of the scholars selected are/were leaders in their subfield. They are certainly beginning to show their age, but it was a monumental undertaking. As reference guides, published by probably the leading publisher in the fields, with only the most prominent scholars, they volumes are priced accordingly. These books are consciously designed and priced to sit in a reference section of a library. As reference guides, they are also not really designed to be read straight through. When I was working on my dissertation about Italy in the later Middle Ages and needed to refer to early periods and I needed to understand the dissolution of the Carolingian Italy and identify the editions of original language standard texts from the period, I turned there first and delved into the footnotes. If you are beginning your forays into the Middle Ages, I’m not even sure that this would be the place to start. Does somebody need to understand the specifics of the career of Berengar II to understand the breakdown of Carolingian authority in Northern Italy? Not as much as the broad patterns at play, and, at a certain point, too much detail can obfuscate the broader patterns. While this is at the forefront of my mind, I wonder if Brill’s new handbooks of medieval Europe will replace Cambridge as the paramount guide for early career scholars [https://brill.com/view/serial/BCEH](https://brill.com/view/serial/BCEH). The ones I’ve used are certainly superior.

But back to the main question. If your goal is a broad understanding of medieval history from the fall of Rome to the beginning of modernity, I’d suggest just getting a textbook. It’ll be cheaper, more manageable, and will not be a fire hose of information. I like rosenwein’s two volume set myself.

I'm afraid that NCMH series has not been superseded by any of the alternative series, at least from a point of view of cost-performance wise and details.

The following recommendations, as already noted by [/u/Kerravaggio](https://old.reddit.com/u/Kerravaggio)

, cannot match the details of the series, but are selected mainly based on cost-wise and the whether it reflects the relatively recent results of the academic research:

- [Wickham, Chris. _Medieval Europe_. New Haven: Yale UP, 2016](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300228823/medieval-europe): is probably the most generally recommended book for the whole Middle Ages in one volume, and its chapters are arranged by the topic as well as the chronological order.  
    
- [Fried, Johannes. _The Middle Ages_, trans. Peter Lewis. Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 2017](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674975361): has a strong point in intellectual history, and translated work by the one of the leading medieval history scholars in Germany. Note, however, that please don't blame the translator for the readability of the text, since the original German text is sometimes already difficult.  
    
- [Lansing, Carol & Edward D. English (eds.). _A Companion to the Medieval World._ Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2009](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/A+Companion+to+the+Medieval+World-p-9781405109222): is probably not the best (especially in detailed information like proper names), but it is a balanced overview work (both content- and cost-performance wise, and in its readability as well), and includes 27 mainly thematically arranged introductory essays written by specialist in individual field of research.
- Among [Short Oxford History of Europe](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/s/short-oxford-history-of-europe-sohe/?) series: [McKitterick, Rosamund (ed.). _The Early Middle Ages: Europe 400-1000_. Oxford: OUP, 2001.](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-early-middle-ages-9780198731733?) ; [Daniel Power (ed.). _The Central Middle Ages: 950-1320_. Oxford: OUP, 2006](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-central-middle-ages-9780199253128?); [Isabella Lazzarini (ed.). _The Later Middle Ages._ Oxford: OUP, 2021](https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/the-later-middle-ages-9780198731634?): are three-volume sub series covering the whole European Middle Ages. It is probably the most text-book like (readability vs in-depth-contents) books in this list. While Lazzarini's _Later Middle Ages_ has just been published, the majority of the contents also of that latest book had already been written in the first decade of the 21th century.  
    
- [Blockmans, Wim & Peter Hoppenbrouwers. _Introduction to Medieval Europe 300–1500_. 3rd ed. London: Routledge. 2017](https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-Medieval-Europe-3001500/Blockmans-Hoppenbrouwers/p/book/9781138214392): is the textbook for the European Middle Ages recommended in [this subreddit's book list section](https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-Medieval-Europe-3001500/Blockmans-Hoppenbrouwers/p/book/9781138214392) (found on the right column).
