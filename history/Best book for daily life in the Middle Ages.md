I'm going to start this with a couple of anti-recommendations. Specifically, I don't recommend Joseph and Frances Gies' _Daily Life in a Medieval Castle_ and _Daily Life in a Medieval Town_, and I don't recommend Ian Mortimer's _Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England_.

In the case of the Gies, their first few books can be very hit and miss, and in the case of their first two _Daily Life_ books scholarship has moved on a fair bit. I've still got them on my shelf and there are a few interesting anecdotes or pieces of colour that can be pulled from them, but I recommend reading them _after_ you've got a more up to date grounding.

Ian Mortimer's _Time Traveller's Guide_ suffers from both what appears to be a hurried writing process and from desire to keep a certain level of disdain for medieval people. On a few occasions he cites authors, such as Christopher Dyer, as being in support for his position when they're in the exact opposite camp or chooses to go with a more minimalist position on numbers while acknowledging a sometimes substantially larger alternative in the footnotes. In other cases, as with the age at which noblewomen first gave birth or the size of medieval arrows he has been unaware of the general trend of research or has accidentally mistranslated sources. The bibliography can be useful, but I do recommend getting a pretty decent grounding before you read him as well.

Okay, on to recommendations.

There are a good number of books in this category, and twelve of them come Greenwood Press. Their _Daily Life Through History_ series includes a wide variety of books on life in the medieval world - primarily Western Europe but also other areas - and they've all been written by professional historians, drawing on current scholarship. The downside to the books are that some of them are over twenty years old now and showing some of their age, as well as an exorbitant price. I recommend getting them in on inter-library loan or buying them second hand. The older editions can be very cheap, although also be aware that some of them have an updated second edition that is more up to date and sometimes much longer.

A list of the ones you might be particularly interested in:

- _Daily Life of Women in Medieval Europe_, by Belle S. Tuten
- _Daily Life in Anglo-Saxon England (2nd Ed.)_, by Sally Crawford
- _Daily Life of Women in Chaucer's England_, by Jennifer C. Edwards
- _Daily Life in Renaissance Italy_, by Elizabeth Storr Cohen and Thomas Vance Cohen
- _Daily Life in a Medieval Monastery_, by Sherri Olson
- _Daily Life in Chaucer's England (2nd Ed.)_, by Jeffrey L. Forgeng and Will Mclean
- _Daily Life during the Black Death_, by Joseph Patrick Byrne
- _Daily Life in the Byzantine Empire_, by Marcus Louis Rautman
- _Daily Life in the Mongol Empire_, by George Lane
- _Daily Life of the Jews in the Middle Ages_, by Norman Roth
- _Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World_, by James E. Lindsay
- _Daily Life in Medieval Europe_, by Jeffrey L. Singman

There are a good number of others published by other authors and companies, however. Joseph and Frances Gies' _Daily Life in a Medieval_ village is excellent scholarship that made good use of archaeological evidence as well as surviving primary sources and secondary scholarship.

Kieth D. Lilley's _Urban Life in the Middle Ages 1000-1450_ lacks a lot of the colour of the Gies, but provides a solid introduction to the evolution of medieval towns and their social and legal underpinnings. You probably won't get much on how people functionally lived out their lives on a day to day basis, but it will give you a good idea of how the towns themselves functioned within the larger medieval world.

Barbara Hanawalt's _Growing up in Medieval London_, on the other hand, is chock full of information on the daily lives of medieval children, from birth to adulthood, based on her studies of medieval records. She reconstructs several moments in the lives of different fictional characters based on an amalgamation of surviving records and really brings her research to life. A more academic book of hers, _The Ties That Bound: Peasant Families_ is also worth a read if you have the inclination, and any academic discussion of medieval English life will refer to it repeatedly.

Along more academic lines are also Christopher Dyer's _Standards of Living in the Later Middle Ages: Social Change in England c. 1200â€“1520 (Revised Edition)_, a textbook published by Oxford University Press, _Everyday Life in Medieval England_ (a collection of his essays) and _Making a Living in the Middle Ages: The People of Britain 850-1520_ (on the evolution of the economy from a somewhat more personal level). Fair warning, Dyer can be pretty dry, but if you want the facts and figures it's hard to go past him.

So far these have all had a distinctly English bent, mostly because it's hard to find good English language "Daily Life" books for non-English speaking areas, but there _are_ a couple of older works that can rectify this a little. Robert Fossier's _Peasant Life in the Medieval West_ focuses on a broader area of Europe, with some slight preference for France, as does Hans-Werner Goetz's _Life In The Middle Ages: From the Seventh to the Thirteenth Century_ with a somewhat German bent. Jean Chapelot and Robert Fossier's _The Village & House in the Middle Ages_, although about the archaeology of villages and houses rather than daily life specifically, is also worth reading.

Another collection of books covering broader topics are Paul B. Newman's _Daily Life in the Middle Ages_, _Growing Up in the Middle Ages_ and _Travel and Trade in the Middle Ages_. These are all about the nuts and bolts of medieval life, like how food was cooked, furniture was made, trade was conducted, what sort of clothing was worn, etc. They don't provide much in the way of the structure of medieval life, but they do cover the elements that generally don't get as much of a look in with traditional books.

There are plenty more books out there, but I've tried to limit myself to books I've read or at least thoroughly skimmed. Let me know if there's any area I haven't covered that you're especially interested in, and I'll see what I can do to fill that gap.
