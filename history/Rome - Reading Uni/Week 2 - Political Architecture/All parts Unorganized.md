###  Part 4: The Forum


The developing character of the Forum as a place of sacred, civic, and legal character is seen in the Black Stone (lapis niger), an area marked off by dark limestone paving near the much later Arch of Septimius Severus. Roman writers knew that there was something ancient and special about this site, but were not quite sure what:

> _The Black Stone in the Comitium indicates a place of burial. Some say it was intended to be the burial spot of Romulus, before he disappeared and made his burial impossible. Others say his foster-father Faustulus was buried here; others that it was Hostilius, grandfather of the Roman king Tullius Hostilius._
> 
> Festus _184L_

the black stone(s) here are paving markers over not (as far as we know) a burial, but an ancient tufa pillar, probably from the sixth century BC, on which an inscription in archaic Latin provides tantalizing clues about this very early period in Rome’s history.

text seems to mention a ‘king’ and issues sacred prohibitions against various acts including desecrating the site of the inscription itself, implication is that the Forum space from a very early date had a connection to law-making, monumentalisation, some sort of political or priestly authority, and sacred activities

connection between sacred and the political is not surprising
the senate house (or curia) which was in fact a ‘_templum_’ – not a temple as we might think, but a space formally consecrated by Rome’s soothsayers or ‘augurs’.

> _[The Roman writer Varro] has written about the places in which a decree of the senate can be issued, and had shown us that unless such a decree is made in a place properly appointed by the augurs, such that we call it a templum, it is not legally correct. For this reason the curia Hostilia, the curia Pompeia and the Julia, none of them sacred sites, were approved as templa by the augurs, so that senatorial decrees could be issued in them according to this custom of our forefathers._

senate house we see in the Forum today was built by Diocletian after a fire in AD 283

was started in 52 BC by a mob who raised an impromptu pyre to the murdered popular politician and gang leader Publius Clodius, a reminder of the Forum’s role as a theatre of lively, even violent politics in the dying years of the republic

dissent, violence, and political grandstanding had long been part of the Forum’s history in the lively years of the republic.

#### 2.6 Walkaround: The Basilica Julia

The Basilica Julia is one of the aisled basilica buildings that lined the long sides of the Forum space. Basilicas were used as law courts, banking halls, and places for many sort of civic meetings and events.

The site for this one had once been used for aristocratic housing and shops, but as the Forum gradually took a more monumental, civic character these were replaced by a basilica (the Sempronia) in the second century BC. Julius Caesar began a new basilica on the site, which his heir Augustus finished and then rebuilt again after a fire, dedicating it in AD 12. It used a lot of white and coloured marble – see what impression you get of the building as you walk around its spacious halls, built to accommodate crowds at the trials and ceremonies it housed. The emperor Caligula, Suetonius tells us, threw coins to the people from the roof of the building in one of his eccentric displays of populism. Perhaps you would like to ‘climb’ up to the roof too.

#### 2.9 Momentual Architecture 
obelisks, commemorative arches, memorial columns, statues, tombs and the funerary inscriptions. These served to act as visual markers of a person, place, event, or concept that their builders felt deserved a permanent place in the crowded city.

In a city of hills and valleys, height was a good tool for catching the eye and the spiral columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius pierced the rooftop

Rome’s needle-like obelisks occupied prominent and imposing positions in the city.

#### Poetic tours of Rome

**Virgil, _Aeneid_ 8.337-61. The Arcadian settler Evander shows the Trojan leader Aeneas around the future site of Rome in this epic poem about Rome’s origins.**

> _Scarcely had these things been spoken; next, going forward, he points out both the altar and the gate which the Romans call by the name Carmental, an ancient tribute to the nymph Carmentis, a fate-speaking seer, who first prophesied that the descendants of Aeneas would be great and Pallanteum distinguished. After this he points out a vast grove which spirited Romulus transformed into the asylum, and the Lupercal beneath a chilly cliff, named from Lycaean Pan after the Arcadian manner. Furthermore, he points out also the wood of the holy Argiletum, and calls the place as witness and tells of the death of his guest Argus. After this he leads him to the Tarpeian abode and the Capitol, now golden but once rough with wooded thickets. Already at that time the awesome holiness of the place used to terrify the trembling rustics, already at that time they used to shudder at the wood and the rock. ‘This grove’, said he, ‘this hill with its leafy peak a god inhabits (which god, it is uncertain); the Arcadians believe they have seen Jupiter himself, when often he shook the dark aegis in his right hand and roused the stormclouds. Moreover, you see these two towns with broken walls, the remains and monuments of men of old. This citadel father Janus founded, this one Saturn; this one had the name Janiculum, that one Saturnia.’ As they said such things among themselves, they entered the dwelling of the pauper Evander, and on all sides they saw cattle mooing in the Roman forum and the smart Carinae._  

**Ovid, _Tristia_ 3.1.21-74. Ovid, banished from Rome by the emperor Augustus, imagines his book of poems visiting sites in the city that he is no longer able to visit in person.**

> _When I had spoken these things with faltering tongue, there was scarcely one person to show me the way: ‘May the gods grant to you what they have not bestowed upon our poet [i.e. Ovid] – to be able to live comfortably in your native land. Come, then, lead me; I shall follow, although I come bearing my foot in exhaustion over land and sea from a distant world.’ He obeyed, and as he led me, he said, ‘This is Caesar’s forum; this is the Way that has its name from the sacred rites; this is Vesta’s spot, which preserves the Palladium and the fire; this was the little palace of ancient Numa.’ Then, making for the right, he said, ‘That’s the gate of the Palatine; here’s [Jupiter] Stator; in this spot Rome was first founded.’ While I am marvelling at each and every thing, I see doorposts conspicuous with gleaming weapons and a dwelling worthy of a god. ‘Is this Jupiter’s home as well?’, I said; what made me think this was the augury given to my mind by a wreath of oak. When I heard its master, I said, ‘I’m not wrong, it’s true that this home is mighty Jupiter’s too. But why is the door veiled by laurel placed in front of it, and why does a shady tree place round it its august foliage? Is it because that house has earned constant triumphs, or because it has always been loved by the Leucadian god? Is it because it is joyful itself, or because it makes all things joyful? Or is that a mark of the peace it has bestowed upon the earth, and as the laurel is forever green and is not plucked with falling leaves, so the house has everlasting glory? The reason for the wreath placed over it is declared by a caption: it declares that the citizens have been saved by the aid of this man. Add to those you have saved one citizen, most excellent father, who lies far off, banished at the edge of the world, in whose case no crime accounts for his punishment – which he confesses he deserved – but his own error. Wretched me! I fear the spot and I fear the powerful one, and my lettering is shaken with trembling dread. Do you see my paper grow pale with bloodless hue? Do you see my alternating feet [i.e. the alternating long and short lines of the elegiac metre] tremble? At some time, I pray, may you be on good terms with my parent, and may you be seen by him, O house, under the same masters!’ After that, at an even pace, I am led up by the lofty steps to the shining temple of the unshorn god, where there are statues alternating with the foreign pillars – the daughters of Belus and their father, barbaric with his drawn sword – and whatever men ancient and modern have conceived in their learned breast is available for inspection by those who wish to read. I started to look for my siblings, obviously excluding those [the Ars amatoria] whom their own father would wish he had not brought to birth. As I looked in vain, the custodian appointed to that place ordered me to depart from the holy spot. I make my way to another temple, joined to a neighbouring theatre [the theatre of Marcellus]; access to this too was forbidden to my feet. Nor did Liberty allow me to touch her halls [the temple of Liberty, with a library founded by Asinius Pollio], which were the first open to learned books. The fate of the wretched father spills over on to his offspring, and we his children endure the banishment that he himself bore._ 

**Propertius 2.31 [Temple of Apollo]. Propertius describes Augustus’ temple of Apollo on the Palatine, dedicated in 28 BC.**

> _You ask why I come to you rather late? The golden portico of Phoebus has been opened by mighty Caesar. The whole thing had been extended into a walkway with Punic columns, with the female crowd of old Danaus between them. Here indeed a marble [statue], more beautiful than Phoebus himself, seemed to me to mouth a song with a silent lyre; and around the altar stood Myron’s cattle, four cows of the sculptor, lifelike statues. Then in the middle, in gleaming marble, rose the temple, more precious to Phoebus than even his Ortygian homeland. On this was the chariot of the Sun above its gables, and its doors, a distinguished work of Libyan ivory; one of these mourned the Gauls cast down from the peak of Parnassus, the other mourned the deaths of Tantalus’ daughter Niobe. Then between his mother and his sister the god himself, the Pythian, in a long cloak, sounds his songs._

**Ovid, _Fasti_ 5.549-70 [Temple of Mars Ultor]. In Ovid’s poem on the Roman calendar, the god of war visits the temple dedicated to him in the Forum of Augustus.**

> _Am I mistaken, or do weapons sound? I am not mistaken, weapons were sounding: Mars is coming, and as he comes he has given the signal for war. The Avenger is coming down from heaven in person to his own honours and his marvellous temple in the Augustan forum. Both the god and the work are massive: in no other way was it right for Mars to dwell in the city of his son. This shrine is worthy of trophies taken from Giants; from here it is fitting that Gradivus [an epithet of Mars] should set in motion fierce wars, whether someone impious will provoke us from the eastern world or someone from the land of the setting sun will need to be overcome. The one powerful in arms looks over the gables of the supreme work and approves that unconquered gods should occupy the highest point. He looks over weapons of different shape on the doors, and the earth’s arms defeated by his own warfare. On this side he sees Aeneas weighed down by his dear burden, and so many ancestors of the Julian aristocracy; on this side he sees Ilia’s son [Romulus] bearing on his shoulders the chieftain’s arms, and sees that famous deeds appear beneath the heroes arranged in order. He gazes also at the temple fronted by the name Augustus, and the work seems greater when Caesar’s name has been read. This he had vowed as a young man at that time when he took up pious arms: from such great undertakings it was right for him to begin his principate._
