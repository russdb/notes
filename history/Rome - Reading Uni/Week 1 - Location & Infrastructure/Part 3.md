### Part 3: Aquaducts and Sewage

#### 1.14 Aqueducts and drainage

Cisterns can store run-off water funnelled in from roofs: many of Pompeii’s houses had this practical system, storing rainwater in cool underground cisterns to last through the dry Mediterranean summer.  

were limits to these sources, which were strained as a city’s population density grew

Wells gradually depleted the water table, and were no good if a dense urban population polluted the groundwater with sewage, rubbish, and the burial of the dead  

For the fountains and bathhouses that the Romans loved, flowing water was neede  

principle was relatively simple: pure and abundant sources in the hills around Rome could be tapped, and their waters diverted into artificial channels running gently towards the city on a gradient designed to deliver them at a useful height, to flow around the city and feed street fountains, baths, and (for a fee) private houses.

> _… having added the Aqua Virgo and repaired the other aqueducts, renewing their channels, made 700 basins, as well as 500 fountains, and 130 castella, many of which were richly decorated, and in these works he erected 300 bronze or marble statues and 400 columns of marble…_

since aqueducts could not readily be turned off, arrangements had to be made to ensure the new water could be drained into the Tiber, often flushing sewers or roads as it went. For most of its route an aqueduct could flow in a relatively cheap underground culvert, but as the land dropped away into the Tiber valley the aqueduct channels had to emerge from the ground, supported on tiers of arcades as they approached the city. Many of these arcades survive

irst aqueduct, the Aqua Appia, was built in 312 BC  

brought water in from about 16km away, ran almost all its length underground, and could only supply a small and low-lying part of the city
Within 170 years an aqueduct (the Marcia) was built that tapped springs over 90km away, and ran for over 10km on arches; by the first century AD the entire city was served by aqueduct

we’ve a good idea of the sheer scale of the city’s water system from Frontinus and from other sources, including a fourth-century catalogue of city buildings which lists:

-   19 aqueducts
-   1352 public fountains
-   254 reservoirs
-   15 large ornamental _nymphaea_ (fountains)
-   11 great imperial _thermae_ (large bathhouses)
-   and 856 smaller _balneae_.

around a million cubic metres per day are suggested

system gradually fell out of use.

By the twelfth century Rome – now shrunk down to just the area of the Campus Martius in the loop of the Tiber – was once again relying on river and well water.  

#### 1.17 sewers 
When the aqueducts arrived in Rome, bringing a huge volume of water, the challenge of disposing of it (and the opportunity of using it to help flush away dirt) reached a new magnitude.
The Great Drain, the Cloaca Maxima, was part of the city’s legendary history, attributed to the city’s sixth-century BC kings (who used forced citizen labour to build it).emerging into the Tiber through an archway which is still visible.

famous across the ancient world.
Marker monuments on the surface reminded people of the underground presence of the Great Drain Ancient authors also celebrated Rome’s drains.

> _For although the Greeks seemed to have aimed well in the foundation of their cities, since they aimed at beautiful sites which were naturally strong, and well provided with strong positions and harbours and good land, the Romans used good foresight in those matters that the Greeks did not much bother with, the construction of roads and the bringing in of water and of sewers able to wash out the filth of the city into the Tiber … the sewers, covered over with close-fitted stones, leave room in places for hay wagons to pass through._
