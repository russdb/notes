### Part 2: Walls, Roads and building materials  

#### 1.9 Introduction to building materials and techniques  
What tends to survive best is cheap, sturdy concrete at sites like the Baths of Caracalla. Valuable materials like marble, cut stone and the lead-sheathed iron clamps that held it together, were removed throughout the middle ages and into the renaissance by builders scavenging ‘spolia’  


remains of the city use a distinctive palette of materials: travertine and tufa stone along with reddish-orange Roman brick are familiar structural ingredients.  

richly coloured marble and patterns of clamp-holes where it was once fixed to brick walls show how some buildings once boasted lavish surface decoration

materials used by Roman builders can tell us a lot. Architects had to balance the desire to achieve a grand visual effect on the one hand, and to stick within a reasonable budget on the other. The Roman architect Vitruvius, writing in the first century BC, tells us:

> _‘Efficiency’, however, is the appropriate arrangement of resources and of the site, and the moderation of expense in the work by means of thrifty reasoning. This will be attended to if in the first place the architect does not require what cannot be found or prepared only at great expense. For it is not everywhere that there is a supply of quarry sand or stone or fir wood or pine or marble, but each thing is found in a different location, and their transportation can be difficult._
> 
> Vitruvius, _On Architecture 1.3_  

cutting and transporting heavy stone blocks was particularly expensive.  
gave stone masonry a prestige factor 

emperors’ imports of huge granite column shafts and the obelisks from Egypt, for example, was a deliberate demonstration of logistical power and expense  

Roman builders gained more materials and techniques with which to work. At first, the only stone available to them was the local volcanic Cappellaccio tufa  

As the city’s power grew, new quarries of better stone further afield were opened up.  

For decorative detail early Roman builders had to rely on moulded terracotta and carved, painted wood.  

from the second century BC, Rome opened up quarries for travertine on the road out to Tivoli, close enough to the city to be economical. Travertine is an attractive white limestone (not as pure and brilliant as some of the Greek marbles) capable of being carved to a nice crisp edge, and is still widely used in architecture today

By the mid-second century BC, Rome was also importing luxurious white marble from the Greek world  

round ‘Temple of Hercules Victor’, which you’ll see more of in Week 3, is a good early example of Greek marble and architectural style at Rome  

![[Pasted image 20211117163257.png]]  

By around 50 BC, the Romans had found an Italian source of white marble in the Alpine Luna quarries  
Rome was flooded with exotic coloured marbles from her growing empire. The columns and floors of imperial buildings like the Pantheon are, as you’ll see, good places to see displays of polished, coloured marble  
imported marble was generally reserved for surface decoration, often in thinly cut veneers  
development of concrete to form the structural core of buildings was one of the most important innovations in Roman architecture  
quicker to use than cut stone, and its raw materials are cheap and easy to transport  
uses less skilled labour, and doesn’t require so much heavy lifting equipment.  
can be laid in almost any shape over wooden centering that is removed when the concrete is ‘cured’ or set, allowing huge, geometrically intricate vaults.  
shift from the externally focused, columnar architecture of the Greek world to Rome’s architecture of interior, vaulted spaces was one of Rome’s major stylistic contributions to architectural history.  
Its legacy lives on in architecture like Grand Central Station in New York, modelled on vaulted Roman bathhouse halls  
Roman concrete that made this soaring architecture possible consisted of a cement mortar holding chunks of stone (‘aggregate’),  mixed with pozzolana, a volcanic sand.  
seem to have started using concrete as early as the third century BC; one of the earliest surviving structures to use it extensively
repeated identical vaults also reduced the cost of construction – once one vault was built, its wooden centering could be moved and reused for the next  
developed different facing materials for their concrete, to achieve a smooth, even finished surface that protected the concrete core of the building. One early technique was ‘_opus reticulatum_’, the technique of laying nodules of tufa stone in a regular grid.
![[Pasted image 20211118004330.png]]  

By the imperial period the facing material of choice was usually bricks, made in their tens of millions in imperial brickyards

This clever building system, ‘_opus latericium_’ maximised the efficient use of cheap unskilled labour in both production and construction  

using slaves and the urban poor in imperial job-creation schemes  

The reason Roman concrete is so strong is due to a chemical reaction between sea water and volcanic ash used in the mixture.

Rome is a city of hills and valleys. This, together with the River Tiber, must have been important reasons why the area’s first inhabitants chose to settle there.


legendary founder was Romulus, twin brother of Remus. S  

Archaeological evidence, like post holes and burials, suggest that individual villages on Rome’s hilltops gradually merged into a unified community. 

total of seven legendary kings ruled the city. These figures are more or less mythical.  

might at least be able to tell us something about how later Romans saw the origins and character of their city. These kings assisted in Rome’s rise to military and civic greatness. Draining the Forum space and building the Capitoline Temple, for example. But their rule could be harsh and their power was absolute. Eventually the Romans resented the all-powerful rule of these kings and rose up against them, expelling the last king, the violent tyrant Tarquinius Superbus, and establishing in his place a republican form of government. The traditional date for this is 509 BC.  

ower in this new Roman Republic was vested in annually-elected magistrates, always in pairs to stop any one of them gaining king-like powers  

powerful republican state lasted for nearly five centuries, but eventually it, too, failed.  

The last generation of republican politicians, Julius Caesar and Pompey among them, tore the state apart and lurched into outright civil war. 

adopted heir Augustus emerged as the first Roman emperor.  

Augustus set a pattern that later emperors followed. From Augustus, power passed to the backstabbing, murderous Julio-Claudian dynasty of emperors, who nonetheless clung so tightly to power that no serious attempt was made to put anything except more emperors in their place. The last Julio-Claudian emperor was Nero.  forced to commit suicide in AD 68

another period of civil war resulted in more emperors, this time the Flavian dynasty, who built the Colosseum  

With a few ups and downs, the Roman Empire now entered its period of maximum expansion and prosperity, creating many of the finest surviving buildings that we see on this course.  

At the end of the second century AD power passed to the Severan dynasty from North Africa, who restored and upgraded a number of buildings in Rome, adding, among other things, a great bathhouse and carving, as we will see, a useful marble map. From there, things went rather downhill. A series of weak, short-lived emperors were part of a third century malaise or cris  

used cash a lot for daily transactions in their shops and restaurants  

got paid in cash. So they’d carry around handfuls of this loose change. And they’d notice, perhaps, what was on the coins. And it became a very good vehicle for emperors and politicians to discuss or put in front of people buildings, objects, concepts that they wanted to be noticed.  

Lots of these emperors put buildings on their coins. Now, why should that be? The Romans do it far more than any other ancient culture. A lot of their coins have buildings portrayed on them. And I think this is a measure of how important building was to Roman emperors and to the Roman people.  

because they circulated so widely, could go outside of Rome. They could go to people who’d never seen the buildings or had only seen them once. They could act as a reminder and a boast or propaganda, if you like, 

it picks out for us those buildings that they associated with themselves that they wanted to be known for restoring or repairing or constructing  

coins can also be a great source of information for buildings that are now lost to us.  
These are not photographs of the buildings. They’re simplified, stylised, miniaturised versions on coins. Coins are small and round. Romans buildings, by and large, are big and square. Detail gets left out and chopped away by the monier to make it fit inside that very small compass   

Another factor is that, often, these coins show buildings well before they’re actually constructed.

#### 1.11 walls
Though walls could be symbols of urban prestige, they could also be considered an admission that a city faced a military threat  
Rome had no functioning city walls during the centuries of her greatest power and prominence;  
mighty as they are, can therefore be seen as a sign of a weakening empire.  
earliest wall circuit is traditionally called the ‘Servian Wall’ after the legendary king Servius Tulliu
![[Pasted image 20211118010512.png]]

remains must actually come from rather later than King Servius’ traditional sixth century BC date. The wall was built of a grayish tufa stone called Grotta Oscura which came from quarries near Veii, a city which Rome did not capture until 396 BC.  

by then the city was ruled under a republican constitution, not by the kings who were traditionally believed to have built the walls. These walls were one factor that helped turn Rome’s great Carthaginian enemy Hannibal against an attempt to capture the city in 211 BC.  

By the time Rome’s first emperor Augustus took power in the first century BC, this old wall circuit had fallen into disrepair;  
poets of this date refer to the wall’s rampart as a place for strolling where entertainers and fortune tellers could be found  

Greek writer Dionysius of Halicarnassus makes it clear that the city had expanded well beyond the confines of the old wall:

> _And if someone looking at these suburbs should want to estimate the size of Rome, he will be forced to go astray and will have no definite indication by which he can determine the point up to which it is still the city, and from where it begins not to be the city, as the built-up area is so woven into its surrounding countryside, that it gives to those looking at it the impression of a city stretching out forever. But if he should try to gauge Rome’s size by means of the city wall, which is hard to locate because of the buildings that are constructed over and around it in many locations, but which preserves traces of its old course in several places, and to measure it against the wall circuit which surrounds the centre of Athens, the circuit at Rome would not seem to him much larger than that._
> 
> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, _Roman Antiquities 4.13_  

survived until the third century AD without any replacement for this redundant wall. Then threats from the north led the emperor Aurelian to start constructing in AD 271 the 19km circuit which now bears his name.  
Developments in military technology saw the inclusion of large gate towers and platforms for artillery weapons like catapults  
different building material to use, brick-faced concrete, which allowed them to build bigger, faster, and cheaper  
relatively hasty and economical construction of this wall circuit is shown by the way it ‘englobed’ earlier structures where it could, making them part of the wall rather than skirting them or knocking them down  
Aurelianic wall was upgraded in the fourth and fifth centuries AD by the emperors Honorius and Arcadius  
wall could not prevent the eventual sack of Rome by the Goths in AD 410, when they managed to enter by one of its great gates.  
![[Pasted image 20211118010818.png]]  
large sections of this wall circuit still survive – indeed, parts of it were used defensively until as recently as 1870  
often defines the ‘edge’ of the ancient city in maps and plans.  
it was not always that easy to say where the city ended and the countryside began: suburbs of lower density building, parkland, tombs, market gardens, farmland, and industrial sites like brickyards continued out for miles.  

#### 1.12 roads  
In 312 BC, work on one of Rome’s earliest road building projects was commissioned by a Roman politician, Appius Claudius Caecus. The Via Appia named in Appius’s honour ran to the south of Italy.  
Later magistrates added other great roads to the network, often in conjunction with programmes of city foundation and land surveying and distribution, adding up to a potent statement of Roman power over conquered landscapes  
Roman roads were famously straight, tending to disregard natural obstacles in their quest for a direct route.  
ability of their engineers to create the necessary cuttings, embankments, terraces, and even tunnels  
well engineered, with a cambered surface for drainage, compacted layers of gravel of different grades and – where necessary, and possible – paved surfaces.  
quarry beds of hard-wearing volcanic basalt conveniently near Rome  
communications infrastructure included waystations, and even a network of imperial messengers  
emperors took pains not only to extend and restore Rome’s road network, but to let people know that they had done so by putting images and inscriptions on their coins  
![[Pasted image 20211124134925.png]]  
Traces of ancient road surface survive in and around Rome. Roads entered the city from all directions, taking where possible the easy route down the valley bottoms between Rome’s hill spurs.  

Via Salaria (whose name suggests an ancient connection to a traffic in salt) ran from the Adriatic coast over 200km away  
Pliny gives us an idea of the extent of this urban road network:

> _If a measurement is taken from the milestone placed at the head of the Roman forum to each of the gates, which today number thirty-seven … it makes a total of twenty miles and 765 paces. To the edge of the built-up area, including the Praetorian camp, from the same milestone but through the city neighbourhoods, the total measure of all the roads comes to a little but more than 60 miles. If someone were to add in the height of the buildings, he would come to a very reasonable judgement and admit that the size of no city in the entire world could be compared to Rome._
> 
> Pliny, _Natural History, 3.66_    

Ancient authors complain at length about the crowds, dirt, and noise of the city’s roads  

> _The rumble of the wagons through the narrow winding of the streets, the cursing of the carter caught in a traffic-jam, would wrench a dozing seal from his sleep - or an emperor._
> 
> Juvenal, _Satire 3.236–238_  

> _If the tycoon has an appointment, the crowd parts before him as he’s borne above their heads in a huge litter. There’s plenty of room inside: he can read, or take notes, or snooze as he jogs along - those drawn blinds are most soporific. Even so he outstrips us: however fast we pedestrians may hurry crowds surge ahead, those behind us buffet my rib-cage, poles poke into me; one lout swings a crossbeam down on my skull, another scores with a barrel. My legs are mud-encrusted, from all sides big feet kick me, a hobnailed soldier’s boot lands squarely on my toes . . ._

> Juvenal, _Satire 3.241–248_
