I’m [Professor Matthew Nicholls](https://www.futurelearn.com/profiles/316234) and I’m delighted to share with you my virtual model of ancient Rome which I’ve been developing over the past ten years. If you’d like to learn a little more about why I became fascinated in the Romans and their buildings in particular, you’re welcome to read my [biography](https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/files/c4/92/c4929e24-75ab-4365-a39d-a411335cc23c/Professor_Matthew_Nicholls_-_biography.pdf) for details.
