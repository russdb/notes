#### bread and circuses  

> _But what about Remus’ mob? They follow fortune, as always … they discarded their responsibilities long ago … for the people who once handed out power, political office, command of the legions, everything, now holds itself in check and anxious hopes for only two things – bread and circuses._
> 
> Juvenal, _Satire 10, 72 – 81._  

written around the turn of the first to second centuries AD, he summarises the decline of the once-proud Roman people into a self-interested mob of urban parasites.

the ‘mob of Remus’ (implying the common folk of Remus’ Aventine, not the proud stock of Romulus) no longer concerned itself with such matters, as long as the supply of cheap food and entertainment was guaranteed by its imperial masters.

overall his characterisation of the emperors’ bargain with the Roman people – free or subsidised food and entertainment in return for political obedience – has a ring of truth to it

‘circuses’? really meant the complete package of urban entertainment such as chariot racing,  also stage plays, athletics games, bathing, gladiatorial combats and beast hunts.

prime location for chariot racing in Rome was for many centuries the Circus Maximus, located in a long thin valley between the Palatine and Aventine Hills.

Livy attributes the layout of the first stadium there, to one of Rome’s legendary early kings, Tarquinius Priscus (conventional dates: 616-578 BC):

> _It was then [after a victory in war] that a site was designated for the circus that is now called Maximus. Spaces were divided up for the senatorial and knightly orders where they could each make seats for themselves; these were called ‘rows’ … the entertainment was horses and boxers, mostly imported from Etruria._
> 
> Livy, _1.35._

approximate date and royal Etruscan origins of circus entertainment in Rome may be about right; certainly chariot racing had a long history at Rome
Any spectacle that needed a large arena and plenty of seating, like Caesar’s show of exotic elephants, might use it.
Circus was also on the route of the triumphal processions
Rome’s emperors continually upgraded the circus
Dio tells us that Agrippa installed lap counters in the Circus in 33 BC, to help people keep track of how many circuits had been completed

Suetonius tells us that Augustus was always careful to seem interested in the games to preserve a man-of-the-people air:

> _Whenever he was there he did no other business, whether because he wanted to avoid the accusation he recalled had been circulated about his father Julius Caesar, that while watching the games he had spent his time reading and answering letters and petitions, or because he had a real enthusiasm and pleasure in watching._
> 
> Suetonius, _Life of Augustus 45._

Circus Maximus was Rome’s largest Circus – holding around 250,000 spectators and perhaps the largest sporting arena ever built

Stage entertainment had a long history in Rome. The earliest Latin literature that we know of are the scripts of stage plays, translated from Greek models for a Roman audience in the third century BC
If Roman moralists disapproved of the world of the stage, with its disreputable actors, air of unreality, and potential to whip up a crowd’s emotions, the Roman people by and large ignored their warnings

For centuries, only wooden theatres and amphitheatres were permitted.

> _Since I have made mention of entertainments, I will not omit to say that in all the great variety of stage sayings, there was never a point, at which something said by the playwright seemed relevant to our own times, which either escaped the notice of the people as a whole, or which the actor himself failed to bring out._
> 
> Cicero, _Pro Sestio 55._

#### 5.8
900 bath houses located through out the city
agrippa built the first one in 19bc
nero's were amazing\
trajan built first imperial bath house 
now a days it is a park but a lot of ruins remain
model of bathouse design
could listen to music or philosophy while you bathed.

#### 5.9 baths
central experience of urban life in ancient Rome; the building of bathhouses all over the Roman world, from the forts on Hadrian’s wall to the cities of north Africa, shows how important it was.
![A map showing where all the big baths of ancient Rome were located](https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/77/19/hero_7719184e-d908-4c77-b82e-0cdc27af0e99.jpg)

bathing establishments of all sizes, public and private, filled the city
largest imperial _thermae_ offered a complete day out at no or little cost, with huge bathing halls, extensive gardens, art collections, statue galleries, and perhaps even libraries
maller _balneae_ might have had a more familiar, neighbourhood feel and a regular clientele
Seneca helps bring a Roman bathhouse alive for us, when he complains about the noises that drift into his apartment from a nearby bath:

> _I have lodgings right over a balneum. So now imagine for yourself the all the different sounds, which lead me to loathe my own ears! When strong men are exercising and their heavy hands are throwing lead weights about; when they are either working hard, or else pretend to be working hard, I can hear their grunts; and whenever they hold their breath and then let it go, I can hear their wheezes and heavy breathing. When I notice a lazy fellow, content with a cheap oiling and rub-down, I hear the crack of the masseur’s hand striking his shoulders; the sound changes according to whether the hand hits flat or hollow. … Add to this the quarrelsome type, and arrest of thief, and the man who likes to hear the sound of his own voice in the bath. Now add those who jump into the swimming pool with the din of splashing water … now think of the thin and strident voice of the hair-plucker, which he uses to get noticed, continually calling out and never quiet unless he is plucking hair and making someone else yell instead. Now the varied cries of the cake-seller and the sausage-seller and the confectioner and all the food vendors, selling their wares with their own distinctive cries._
> 
> Seneca, _Letters 56._

popularity of bathing, and the arrival of the aqueducts delivering huge volumes of water, gave Rome’s emperors the opportunity to develop luxurious bathhouses

5.13 The Colosseum 
land was originally for nero, but "returned" to the many people after his death, his huge statue turned into the god of sun helios, a colossus where the colosseum derives it's name
Vespasian’s Colosseum was home to beast hunts, public executions, and gladiatorial combat, staged before an audience of up to 50,000 people.
Originally the gladiatorial combats were held in temporary wooden buildings,

built in 10 years
arena comes from lating word for sand to soak up blood from combat sport
word ‘amphitheatre’ comes from the Greek word for ‘double theatre’:

> _He announced a gladiatorial show and a feast to the people in memory of his daughter, a thing which no one had done before. To make sure that this was as keenly anticipated as possible, he had the material for the banquet prepared in part by his own household…_
> 
> Suetonius, _Life of Julius Caesar, 26_

The old republican magistrates only held office for a year, which limited their ambition and ability to create expensive permanent venues (that their rivals might then use later). When the emperors were in power, permanent arenas became possible.

building was used by monks and all kinds of tings after christianity banned the act of gladiator sport
slaves foreigners and women sat near the top. the more important, the closer you sat
