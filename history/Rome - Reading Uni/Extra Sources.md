Further resources  
Additional resource  
For those of you keen to continue your studies in ancient Rome, here is a collection of  
suggested further reading material provided by myself and the contributors to the course.  
Digital model  
• Matthew’s blog on his digital modelling work is here.  
• There various videos of him discussing his work online, including a talk about the  
modelling process here and an interview (with James Lloyd, the musician!) here.  
• Here’s an article about the project in the British Academy Review.  
General histories of the city of Rome  
Chr. Hibbert, Rome: The Biography of a City (Penguin, 1987).  
J.H.S. McGregor, Rome from the Ground Up (The Belknap Press, 2005).  
Overviews of ancient Rome  
For convenience I will refer to several chapters in this collection of short thematic essays  
as good starting points for reading more (follow the authors’ references for more detailed  
works if you want to):  
J. Coulston and H. Dodge (ed.), Ancient Rome: The Archaeology of the Eternal City  
(Oxford University School of Archaeology Monographs) (Oxford University Press,  
2000).  
P. Erdkamp, ed, The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Rome (Cambridge, 2013).  
C. Edwards and G Woolf, eds, Rome the Cosmpolis (Cambridge, 2003).  
I.M. Barton, Roman Public Buildings (Exeter, 1989) has good short introductions to some  
of the different categories of building that we meet on this course.  
For an overview of Roman history and society in short bite-size chapters, I might  
recommend my own recent book:  
M.C. Nicholls, ed., 30-Second Ancient Rome (Ivy Press, 2014).

If you like it, there’s a children’s version and a companion volume on the Greeks too...  
Single volume archaeological guides  
If you’re going to pack one book to take round Rome with you on a tour of the  
monuments, I’d recommend:  
A. Claridge, Rome (Oxford Archaeological Guides) (Oxford University Press, 2nd ed.  
2010): indispensable single-volume guidebook. cf:  
Also good is: F. Coarelli Rome and Environs: An archaeological guide (University of  
California Press, 2008).  
Archaeology – large reference works  
The major reference work for Rome is the multi-volume, multi-lingual E.M. Steinby, ed.,  
Lexicon Topographicum Urbis Romae, (OUP, 2001) which you will find only in University  
libraries.  
There is also Andrea Carandini’s brand new beautiful two-volume set, the Atlas of  
Ancient Rome, now out in English translation from Princeton University Press. It’ll set you  
back around £180 but it is very beautifully produced. Some rather conjectural  
reconstructions, but useful and elegant maps.  
Another handy reference work, now rather out of date but still useful for its links to  
ancient source material, is Platner and Ashby’s 1929 Topographical Dictionary of Ancient  
Rome which is available online.  
M. Wilson Jones, Principles of Roman Architecture (Yale, 2000) is a good single volume  
guide to the complexities of Roman building design.  
F. Sear, Roman Architecture, and B. Ward-Perkins, Roman Imperial Architecture, are  
older good short introductions.  
If you are interested in reconstruction: J. Packer and G. Gorski, The Roman Forum  
(CUP, 2015). See my short review here.  
Collection of ancient textual sources  
S. L. Dyson, Rome: a living portrait of an ancient city (Johns Hopkins University Press,  
2010).  
J. Carcopino, Daily Life in Ancient Rome, 2nd ed. with a new introduction and  
bibliographic essay by Mary Beard (Yale Univ. Press 2003). A classic, though now  
out of date (1st ed. 1939).
