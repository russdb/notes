#### 3.2 roman religion  

The religion of Rome was profoundly polytheistic, with all manner of gods, lesser deities and guardian spirits influencing almost every aspect of life. So many deities were known that, writing in the first century AD, Pliny claims:

> _… the [city’s] population of divine beings could be thought of as larger than that of humans._
> 
> Pliny, _Natural History 2.16._

over two hundred gods and other divine beings ranging from Jupiter and Mars to the relatively obscure, such as Robigus and Sterculius, gods of mould and manure.

most important group of deities were the Deii Consentes: twelve gods and goddesses of the Roman pantheon: Jupiter and Juno, Neptune and Minerva, Mars and Venus, Apollo and Diana, Vulcan and Vesta, Mercury and Ceres.

same deities, or at least their equivalents, were also worshipped by the Greeks:

Capitoline Triad of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva were fundamental to the religious identity of the city.

king of the gods, Jupiter, was the patron deity of the Roman state and the supreme ruler over laws and social order

goddess Juno (Jupiter’s sister and wife) was the patroness of marriage and childbirth

Minerva, the daughter of Jupiter, was the virgin goddess of warriors, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce and crafts
each of these deities had their own temples at numerous other locations in the cit

many other temples documented within the city that clearly demonstrate the importance of the “main” deities of Rome, with the famous Pantheon (Step 3.9) providing the ultimate example of a purpose-built structure to venerate all the gods.


from the time of Augustus onward, some emperors joined the gods through deification after their death. Well-known examples included Julius Caesar, Augustus, Claudius, Vespasian and his son Titus, Trajan and Hadrian
e emperors were often viewed as semi-divine, and then actively worshipped following their death as part of the imperial cult, not only in Rome but throughout the provinces.
Other divine beings (of which there were many) can also be recognised within the city.

home to a rich variety of exotic cults, predominantly imported from east Mediterranean provinces including Greece, Turkey, Syria and Egypt.

Syrian cults and a Palmyrene sanctuary are documented across the Tiber in Trastevere, the Janiculum and the Vatican

By far the most dominant of all the imported cults was that of Mithras, originating from Mesopotamia, attested at over forty locations including the Baths of Caracalla, the Circus Maximus and the barracks of the Praetorian guard (Castra Praetoria).

demonstrated an exotic, multi-cultural approach to religion by blending key deities with equivalent figures from the Egyptian world and the Near East.

carvings in the Forum of Augustus show the ram-horned hybrid combination of Jupiter with Ammun, the king of the Egyptian gods

here were specific reasons for the appearance of new deities. One example is the Greek healing god Asclepius (Roman Aesculapius) who, following an outbreak of a major plague in 291BC, received a sanctuary on the Tiber island in the anticipation that he would help save the city.

Other gods were introduced during times of war and political crisis:

Rome’s religious diversity is therefore very striking.

hint at the cosmopolitan nature of the city, but also the geographic extent of the Empire

Rome was open to an extraordinary range of religions, but those that suffered from persecution were those seen as subversive or politically and socially challenging

#### 3.6 music in ancient rome

![[Pasted image 20211212163244.png]]  
Rome’s hills were alive with the sound of music, and it played an important part in worshipping the gods. In temples and ceremonies and also in the city’s theatres, streets, and humble homes, music was inescapable.
music (literally ‘of the Muses’), was seen as something inspired by the gods and was performed not just for mortal enjoyment, but in worship to the Roman pantheon too.

Tracks **2**,**4**,**5**,**7** are recordings of improvisations on an _aulos_ (Greek)/ _tibia_ (Latin), with Tracks **1**,**3**,**6** providing introductions.
_tibia_ was played by blowing two separate pipes, each with a double reed, at the same time  

![[Pasted image 20211212163358.png]]

The Louvre _auloi_ were found in Egypt and probably date to around the 4th century BCE. Despite predating 3rd century CE Rome by quite some way, they are actually not too dissimilar to more contemporary examples.
_auloi_ have no key-work, and so can’t modulate between different scales while playing

most popular string instruments were the _lyra_, which was made with a tortoise-shell sound box, and the _cithara_, a much larger lyre-type instrument made of wood with a bigger sound box

One such professional was Mesomedes, the court composer to Roman emperor Hadrian. Mesomedes, who was originally from Crete, was particularly famous for his citharodic music (songs accompanied by the cithara). Four of his songs have even survived with their original musical notation intact; the Invocation of the Muse (**track 9**); Invocation of Calliope and Apollo; Hymn to the Sun; and Hymn to Nemesis.

[Track 8 - introduction to the songs of Mesomedes](https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/assets/14/6f/146fb7a6-0667-4f7b-8b2c-02709652a43f.mp3)

What is strange is that there is no example of Latin musical notation, only Greek, so while Mesomedes was court composer to a Roman emperor, his surviving songs are all written in Greek

Arguably the most famous piece of ancient Roman music is the Seikilos song (**track 10**), which was found inscribed on a funeral epitaph in Turkey,

#### Imperial Temples

it’s clear that temples were embedded within the very fabric of the urban landscape, to say nothing of the numerous smaller shrines and cult places that were dedicated to all manner of Graeco-Roman gods and spirits.

very few of these temples survive intact
majority looted for their building materials in later historical ages
examples that survive best tend to have been preserved through conversion into a church early on in Rome’s Christian history.
groups of fine marble columns and large imposing podiums or temple bases, especially those in the Roman Forum, provide a strong sense of their original architectural scale and splendour
Coins and sculptural reliefs depict temples such as Mars Ultor, helping us to understand their original appearance,
Many of Rome’s imperial-era temples were dedicated to mortals who, after death, were deified and worshipped as part of the imperial cult.
rocess began after the assassination of Julius Caesar; he was the first mortal to receive a temple in the Forum, built by his successor Augustus
temples were also expressions of elite power, built for and paid for by the ruling regime

![[Pasted image 20211212164828.png]]
Roman temples had their own unique character and represented a fusion of both Greek and local Etruscan tradition
majority were rectangular in form and served to house a statue of the god or gods within an internal chamber known as a _cella_.
usually positioned on a tall podium with a frontal flight of steps, thereby enhancing its prominence within the urban landscape
Temple of Saturn is a good example of how imposing these structures could be. Originally standing at a total height of 25 meters, the podium alone was 11 meters tall.

temples featured six or eight tall, marble columns across the front, with further columns running the full length of the podium, usually engaged into the wall of the _cella_.
During the rule of Augustus down to and including that of Vespasian in the later first century AD, columns were usually made from separate blocks of marble; by the time of Trajan and Hadrian in the early second century AD, large monolithic columns of granite were favoured,

imperial Rome particularly favoured the use of Corinthian or composite, luxurious orders that featured finely carved depictions of acanthus leaves in the capitals located at the top of the columns.
![[Pasted image 20211212165014.png]]
From the time of Augustus, temple construction was controlled by the imperial regime, and subsequently reflected imperial wealth and grandeur.
prime example is the temple of Mars Ultor
temple was surrounded by a veritable art gallery of bronze sculptures. Depicting mythological and historical figures from Rome’s history, these sculptures were set in porticoes lavishly decorated with columns and floors of exotic, coloured, marble sourced from northern Italy, Greece, North Africa and Turkey.
![[Pasted image 20211212165104.png]]
engineering skills required to construct the dome demonstrate the Roman mastery of concrete which truly revolutionised architecture and set the Romans free from the relative limits of using blocks of stone and marble alone.

#### 3.13. Worshipping the Gods  

> _Jupiter is called the Best (Optimus) and Greatest (Maximus) for this reason, not because he makes us just, moderate, or wise, but because he makes us safe, unharmed, rich and well supplied._
> 
> Cicero, _The Nature of the Gods 3.87_

Written in the first century BC, this quote from Cicero serves to emphasise the fundamental relation between the mortals and the gods, in this case, the king of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter

combined with numerous accounts in the ancient sources describing ritual activity and religious festivals, help us understand how the Romans worshipped their gods
included a range of traditional ritual practices in a bid to honour, beseech, or placate the gods to win their favour, or understand their divine will.

Romans were deeply superstitious and looked for signs or portents from heaven
one of the biggest fears was the accidental extinguishing of the sacred flame in the Temple of Vesta, considered a terrible omen predicting the destruction of the city.

we know of a specific class of priests who specialised in the Etruscan art of haruspicy (the reading of the organs of sacrificed animals) as a means to understand the will of the gods.

Other interpretative practices were conducted on the Capitoline Hill, where, with clear views over the city, the elite priests known as _augures_ interpreted the flights of birds and other natural phenomena: their influence was such that they had considerable political power.
within the monumental temple to the Capitoline Triad, the Sibylline Books were kept under strict guard (later transferred by Augustus to the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine)
contained predictions of future events and religious observances necessary to avert disaster and misfortune, and were consulted by priests during times of crisis.
construction of a temple (primarily a home for a cult statue of the god in question) was a particularly lasting act of performative religion. Temple buildings could also be political monuments
key aspect of religious ritual was the blood sacrifice of an animal, often a bull, in front of such temples – these buildings were not designed to hold a congregation of worshippers (unlike a church): ritual activity took place outside

would involve a procession leading the animal to the altar, purification rituals and prayers, the pouring of libations and the offering of incense, and then the sacrificial killing of the animal to honour the god.
carcass was subsequently carved up to allow the inspection of the entrails by a specialist priest (a _haruspex_) in a bid to seek signs of divine will
utchered animal offered to the deity and consumed during a ritual feast.
One of the most colourful and lively aspects of religion were the numerous festivals that occurred throughout the year. We know from surviving Roman calendars (_fasti_) that 109 days were dedicated to specific god

sremind us that that state religion was the responsibility of the emperor (always chief priest) and the elite class of priests who practised these rituals

usually accompanied by major spectacles witnessed by the inhabitants of the city and included sacrifices, elaborate processions and the public display of cult statues of the deities.

Complementing these were the sporting contests such as the Roman games (_Ludi Romani_) held for fifteen days each year in September, in the Circus Maximus, in honour of Jupiter. The crowd capacity of this famous venue (variously estimated between 150-250,000 spectators) makes clear the potential scale of these public events and therefore their impact on society.
Many of the festivals were held to honour specific gods

One festival that provides a particularly useful insight into Roman society was the Saturnalia, occurring at the time of the winter solstice: the social order was temporarily reversed, with slaves and their masters swapping roles for the day.
emperors added new festivals to the calendar.

#### 3.14 local religion  
guardian spirits were venerated in peoples’ homes, and local communities were involved in celebrating specific plebeian festivals, which helped to integrate and involve the neighbourhoods within the wider religious practices of the city

Originating in the sixth century BC, the Compitalia was a midwinter festival aimed at the lower classes. Rather than venerating major deities, the purpose of this festival was to honour the local protective spirits known as _lares_ who were believed to reside at the crossroads.

also involved games and various other entertainment led by officials some of whom were slaves
> _During these [festival] days they take off every symbol of their servitude, so that by this act of humanity … they become better disposed to their masters and bear the sorrow of their fate less heavily._
> 
> Dionysius of Halicarnassus, _Roman Antiquities 4.14.2-4._


Shrines from the Augustan era took several forms; some resembled scaled-down versions of temples (_aediculae_) and were used to contain statuettes of the _lares_, personally donated by Augustus to each neighbourhood.

> _… guard all things with their eyes. They stand there for us, and preside over the city’s walls; they are present for us, and bring us help._
> 
> Ovid, _Fasti 5.134-6._

inscriptions on the surviving shrines tell us something about how the cult of the Lares Augusti was organised. R

neighbourhoods were allowed to choose four officers (_magistri vici_) who, in addition to various local civic duties, were in charge of the festival, performed sacrifices and were responsible for the maintenance of the shrines.

After the emperor’s death, these same local officials and the statues from the shrines were involved in the annual games held in his honour in October – an important step in the establishment of the emperor-worship.
In peoples’ homes for example, numerous spirits relating to domestic life and the cult of the dead were recognised, and each household had its own guardian spirits, as did also each male and female citizen

A relatively wealthy family home would typically contain a cabinet-like shrine known as a _lararium_ to house the household gods, the Penates (often also referred to as spirits of the pantry), and the spirits of the ancestors (Lares).

Reminiscent of a small temple, the shrine was decorated with painted plaster (stucco) and was comprised of a raised rectangular platform with a single column supporting a triangular roof.

We know of a particular festival, the Parentalia, held each year in February during which people travelled out to the graves of their family members or patrons to present flowers and food, making a connection with the burial site.

Both the Compitalia and elements of domestic ritual activities therefore present us with useful insights into religion on a local, everyday level. Roman religion played a fundamental role in everyday life for the entire population.
