### Life and Death in Ancient Rome

#### 4.1 how to keep the grain flowing video  
annalina marzano, specialist in food and ag  

rome is a metropolis, 1m in 100ad  
huge variation in diet in the city
cereals, wine and olive oil. wine was good part of caloric intake, served with water and even given to children 
legumes, chickpeas, lentils important everywhere, and vegetables. leaks, onions, cabbage more exitic from literary sources of rich de re conquinaria. fourth century ad book. flamingos and peacocks. it was a display of wealth instead of tastes.  

palatine hill is here we get the word palace. Augustus was a modest house attached to a temple. later emporers got megalomaniac about it. acres of porticos, glass, etc.  

ordinary folk of rome live in apartment blocks. block and concrete for different grades of customer. familiar sort of pattern. not many survive. fragments of a tax survey show apartments.
  dense form of habitation. required the infrastructure for aquaducts and need a food supply. logistics are straining and some emporers almost get kileld when they cant get the grain to run on time.  
  
  iummediate and regional hinterland could not produce enough food. fresh stuff came from surroundings but foods with longer shelf lives came from further abroad from rest of italy and northern africa/egypt.
 Rome relied of bay of naples. food comes in and needs to be transported with smaller festivals on barges on the tiber. complicated process. 
 
 food supply was a big political issue. emporers took great strain to keep food stuffs stocked.  they boasted about it on their coinage, such as nero who minted coins with the harbor and grain being brought in. 
 
 supplies came up the river from ostia to rome itself on the tiber.  barges would moor near a warehouse district behind the avetine hill full of graneries storerooms warehouses etc.  
 
 forum boarium. its origins are a cattle market. vegetable market was further up the street with other specialized markets around the district. cows show us the great markets, nero again. macellum magnum. two story market complex with a dome! we aren't sure where it was located at. nero took the food seriously. 
 
 families would run stores out of the bottom of their apartment blocks.  
 
 #### 4.2 Roman Housing  
 huge gulf between the emperors in their marble halls on the Palatine and the occupants of cheap, top-floor apartments. Lower down the scale again were slaves - though a slave in a rich household might enjoy better accommodation than the very poorest free Roman, unable to afford any sort of housing (i've read people would voluntarily relinquish themselves into slavery or bondage)  
 
 Fourth-century AD historian Ammianus Marcellinus records that some of the city’s homeless sought night-time shelter under the awnings that shaded Rome’s theatre-goers from the day-time sun in some of the splendid entertainment buildings we will encounter next week:

> _… of the multitude of lowest class and greatest poverty, some spend the entire night in wineshops, and many sleep under the awnings of the theatres_
> 
> Ammianus Marcellinus, _14.6.25_

rich and poor were often in close proximity to each other
cooler hilltops were favoured as locations for the villas of the rich,
mixing of rich and poor was always a feature of daily life in the city. Julius Caesar, for example, lived in the notorious Suburra district – perhaps a populist touch - before he became chief priest (a job which came with an official residence).
Sometimes the private land of the super-rich was opened up to public use

Porticus Liviae, a large public portico, was dedicated by Augustus in 7 BC on the site of the demolished villa of the notoriously luxury-loving and cruel aristocrat Vedius Pollio

mixture of rich and poor was also found within individual buildings

better-preserved Pompeian villas suggest that in such buildings slaves might have slept in service areas or corridors only a few feet away from the grand _cubicula_ of their masters: what we might call ‘horizontal stratification’ of the rich and poor.

![[Pasted image 20211212175141.png]]  
Atrium houses could be found in Rome, a
common form of housing in Rome, a densely built-up city with high land prices, was the apartment block or _insula_

> _The very extent of the city and the limitless number of inhabitants causes a need for huge numbers of dwellings. Since a low-rise area could not accommodate such a multitude in the city, the circumstances forced us to turn to making buildings taller._
> 
> Vitruvius, _On Architecture 2.17_

brick and concrete blocks could be ‘vertically stratified’. The lower floors – reached by a shorter climb, and with at least the possibility of flowing aqueduct water – often contained relatively large and pleasant apartment spaces

Higher up the building, the size and quality of the accommodation often declined

> _We inhabit a City that’s held up, for the most part, by thin props. That’s how the landlord’s manager props up collapsing buildings. Once he’s covered up a longstanding, gaping crack he tells us to sleep safe in a tottering ruin. It’s best to live where there’s no fire, no night-time panic. [Your neighbour] Ucalegon is already calling for water, and moving out his few belongings, and already your third floor is starting to smoke: you’re unaware – for if the alarm spreads up the stairwell from the bottom, he’ll be the last to burn who only has the roof tiles between himself and the rain, where the gentle doves find a place for their eggs… … You have to be very rich to sleep well in this City._
> 
> Juvenal, _Satire 3, 193.203, 235._

ground floor of these apartment blocks, as you’ve seen in the marble plan and in the reconstruction, often contained single-room shops or restaurants

Trajan’s markets in Rome offers a good glimpse of this everyday architecture of commercial space with accommodation above,at Ostia, these shop and tavern spaces survive well enough to let the visitor imagine the bustle that must once have filled them

> _The cheeky shopkeepers had appropriated the entire city: no threshold kept within its own limits._  
> _You, Caesar, bade the narrow lanes widen,_  
> _and what had recently been an alleyway was made into a proper thoroughfare._  
> _No column is now encircled with chained-up wine jars,_  
> _nor does the magistrate have to wade through the mud in the middle of the street._ _The barber’s razor is no longer drawn blindly in the midst of a large crowd,_ _the grimy eating house doesn’t occupy the whole street._ _Barber, barman, cook, butcher – they all keep behind their own thresholds._ _Now it’s Rome! Before it was one giant shop._
> 
> Martial, _Epigram 7.61_

#### encountering the evidence, the bakers tomb

bakeries were a big deal because now people didn't need to make their own bread.  

its tomb has a unique physical appearance

not sure but inscription says he was a baker (a pistor), and possibly contracted by the state. Seems to be successful, and the freize displays the entire process of the baking.  

seems to show a mechanical dough mixer powered by a donkey or horse.  

he could be more efficient than other bakers. the circular elemets on the tomb could be the mixers? no one really knows. water mills go back to 1st century ad in rome and italy

#### 4.7 Roman Food Supply
Feeding a city of that size, in an era before mechanised transport or refrigeration, was an enormous undertaking

> _… as consul for the 11th time [23BC] I made twelve grain-handouts of grain I had bought at my personal expense … these handouts of mine never reached fewer than 250,000 men. In [5 BC]… I gave 320,000 of the urban plebs 60 denarii each._
> 
> Res Gestae _Divi Augusti, 15._


If 250,000 adult heads of Roman families received the emperor’s grain handout, the reasoning goes, a total urban population of at least a million seems possible, if not under Augustus then certainly at the city’s high point in the second century AD.

passage shows us that emperors well understood the importance of maintain Rome’s grain supply

> _At the time of a grave shortage of grain I did not refuse the responsibility for the grain supply, which I so administered that within a few days I freed the entire population, at my own expense, from their fear and danger._
> 
> Res Gestae _Divi Augusti, 5._

> _When the grain supply was constricted because of continual droughts, he was held up in the middle of the forum by a mob and showered with insults and bits of bread, such that he was scarcely able to escape to the Palatine Hill by a side entrance; afterwards he gave very thorough consideration to ways to bring food supplies in, even during the winter._
> 
> Suetonius, _Life of Claudius 18._

Claudius’ response included building a large harbour basin at Portus, near Ostia on the sea coast, to give Rome’s grain fleets a safe anchorage where they could transfer their cargoes to river barges to head up to Rome

problem of feeding Rome had preoccupied the city’s rulers since the republican period.
some estimates suggest Rome could have consumed around 400,000 tons of grain annually

![[Pasted image 20211212181236.png]]

Monte Testaccio, a hill made up entirely of broken olive amphorae near the city’s port district, testifies to the comparable scale of the olive oil trade

free market could not do the job by itself.  

politicians had therefore intervened in the grain supply, or _annona_, since the late second century BC.

direct interventions, like Augustus’ purchase of grain for distribution, and also laws which mandated grain sales at subsidised prices

first such law was passed in 123 BC by a fiery politician called Gaius Gracchus

arguably the first in a series of populist political gestures that eventually toppled the republic

in 58 BC Clodius made the grain free and widened the eligibility for receiving it.

Augustus and his imperial successors maintained this system at enormous cost, in the early third century AD Septimius Severus added olive oil, and later on Aurelian added pork and wine.  

other part of this equation was providing the physical infrastructure to maintain Rome’s food supply.  
![[Pasted image 20211212181650.png]]

By the middle to late republic this river connection was served by a dense area of warehouses and loading quays which grew up a bit further down the Tiber behind the Aventine Hill  

### 4.8 Roman Recipes  

# Moretum

First up, something to accompany all that bread. This recipe for _Moretum_, a Roman garlic cheese spread, is taken from a poem in hexameter (probably wrongly) attributed to Virgil, who you’ll hear discussed in our Encountering the Evidence video on poetry. It describes Simylus, a humble farmer, preparing a meal for himself before going out to plough his fields. First he picks the garlic, celery, rue and coriander from his garden and combines them with a hard cheese, olive oil and vinegar, which he then eats with a loaf of freshly baked bread made by his slave.

> _First, lightly digging into the ground with his fingers, he pulls up four heads of garlic with their thick leaves; then he picks slim celery tops and sturdy rue and the thin stems of trembling coriander. With these collected he sits before the fire and sends the slave girl for a mortar. He seasons with grains of salt and after the salt, hard cheese is added; then he mixes in the herbs. With the pestle in his right works at the fiery garlic, then he crushes all alike in a mixture. His hand circles. Gradually the ingredients lose their individuality; out of the many colours emerges one – neither whole green (for the white tempers it), nor shining white ( since tinted by so many herbs). The work goes on: not jerkily, as before, but more heavily the pestle makes its slow circuits. So he sprinkles in some drops of Athena’s olive oil and adds a little sharp vinegar and again works the mixture together. Then at length he runs two fingers round the mortar, gathering the whole mixture into a ball, so as to produce the form and name of a finished moretum._

Olive oil was a vital commodity for the Romans but also seen as a sign of civilisation. It was used extensively, not just in cooking, but also for lighting lamps, for hygiene purposes (part of the routine of going to the baths was to anoint yourself with oil and scrub your body with sand) and it was also added to perfumes and ointments.

olive oil was very popular in Rome, because of Monte Testaccio, essentially a rubbish tip consisting of discarded olive oil amphorae from North African and Spain.

Created over centuries, it was built up by systematically layering broken clay amphorae, emptied of their contents at the nearby port, to create an artificial mound made up of terraced levels

can also learn much about the olive oil trade from the markings on the amphorae, such as the origin of the product and names of the officials.

#### 4.10 Tombs

Rome restricted burials to the area outside the city to beyond a sacred boundary called the Pomerium

A very few exceptions were granted to great public figures, and as the city expanded some earlier tombs found themselves marooned within the new boundary

Romans had no universally shared conception of ‘the’ afterlife, there seems to have been a general desire to be remembered in death

grave provided a final opportunity to boas

, aristocratic funerals could be lavish affairs with a strong message of family pride. Here is a famous description by the Greek historian Polybius:

> _Whenever any of their prominent men dies, as part of his funeral he is carried with all his adornment into the forum to the so‑called rostra, sometimes conspicuous in an upright posture, or (more unusually) reclined.  With all the people standing round, an adult son, if he has left one and he happens to be present, or if not someone else from his family mounts the rostra and speaks about the virtues and achievements of the deceased. In so doing it follows that the multitude are reminded of these deeds and have them brought before their sight, so that not only those who shared in those deeds but also those not connected to them, come to such a pitch of sympathy that the loss seems to be not a private matter for the mourners, but for the people as a whole. After this they bury the dead and perform the customary ceremonies, and then place the image of the deceased in the most conspicuous place in the house, putting a little wooden shrine around it. This image is a mask, bearing the most exact likeness both in its moulding and in its outline. These images they display at public sacrifices, and decorate them carefully, and when someone else from the family dies they take them to the funeral, putting them on men who seem the most similar to each individual in size and general appearance. These men wear togas, bordered with purple if the deceased was a consul or praetor, completely purple if he was a censor, and golden if he had celebrated a triumph or won similar achievements. These men ride in chariots and are preceded by the rods and axes and the other symbols which accompany high office, suited to whatever each man had achieved in the state while alive. When they come to the rostra they all sit down on ivory chairs of office, and there could not be a sight more fine or welcome for a young man ambitious for reputation and virtue. For who would not be inspired to see the images of men renowned for their virtue all together and seemingly alive and breathing? What sight could be finer than this?_
> 
> Polybius, _6.53.8_  

Augustus’ own circular Mausoleum stood a major road at the northern end of the Campus Martius.  

completed early in his reign, around 28BC, a sure sign that he was aiming at a permanent, dynastic presence
tombs of ordinary folk can be found on all the major roads running into and out of the city
Some of these tombs carry carvings that show the trade or profession of the occupant in life,

iterary sources, written largely by an aristocratic elite, are largely silent on such ‘undignified’ commercial matter
nscriptions on some tombs add another layer of valuable information. These texts often name the partner, relative, or friend who erected the monument

For poorer people, including some slaves and freedmen (ex-slaves) there were shared tombs called _columbaria_.
membership rules of some of these burial clubs survive in inscriptions: members paid in a regular fee in return for the promise of burial, and it seems that the clubs could provide a bit of a social life for the living, with commemorative banquets.
second century AD, when burial (rather than cremation) began to be popular again at Rome
catacombs were particularly popular with these outsider groups, who often lacked the resources for (or perhaps interest in) large above-ground monuments,
very poorest,could presumably not count on even the humblest burial.
