'It's complicated.'

There are a few different ways to approach this question.

**Race vs. Ethnicity / Biology vs. Culture**

The big difficulty determining who was an Angle, Saxon, Jute, or Roman Briton isn't just figuring out where they were born or who their parents were. Ultimately, it's a question of culture: what did people *call* themselves? Since few people left written records in these centuries, the answer almost always is that we don't know. There's ample evidence that people interacted across cultural lines: art styles mixed, DNA mixed, migrants and locals were buried in the same cemeteries. This suggests that culture was complicated, much as it is today: someone might not die with the same identity with which they were born. So as we look at the people in England, we honestly struggle to know whether they thought of themselves as Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, or something else entirely.

Until they start writing things down. And when they do, these lines start to be drawn. Early sixth century Britain was pretty fragmented. Halsall in *Worlds of Arthur* argues that the island may have been united into large kingdoms like contemporary Gaul, but in N. Gaul as well there were few elites, and people lived for the most part in tiny rural settlements that were all, roughly, equal to one another. This changed by the seventh century, as new kings emerged in Britain and consolidated their power. These kings were interested in dynasties, and they started to identify with the stories of migration. If you look closely at their family trees, you can see that this process involved some choices. The kings of Wessex, for example, had British names for several generations. But by the seventh century, they identified themselves as West *Saxons*. This is why it's important to remember that culture and identity don't have to match biological ancestry -- these kings *could* have called themselves Romans or Britons, but they chose to emphasize the Saxon migrations for their origins, much as I choose to identify more strongly with the English rather than French or German side of my family tree, while my spouse identifies as Polish instead of German. If we wanted, we could change our last names to O'Brien and convince everyone we were Irish. That, it seems, is what was happening in the seventh century, and perhaps a little earlier in the sixth. People were still moving (isotopic and genetic evidence both show evidence for migrations ongoing in the 7th and 8th centuries), but in England new royal powers had started to settle on stories that made their ancestors out to be heroic conquerors who came from Germany, while in Wales chronicles began to tell stories about Arthur who had valiantly defeated those damned Saxon invaders. Lines were being drawn, and politics were at the heart of it.

**Tying it all together**

So -- were there migrations? Yes.

Was there a violent conquest? Here the evidence is much less certain. Roman Britain changed radically and rapidly, but there's little evidence for violence, and economic and social processes offer better interpretations of the evidence. People *changed*, they weren't slaughtered or driven away.

How many people migrated? This is still contested. If you buy the logic of the recent studies, between 10-40% is likely, but probably not much more. But there's reason to question these numbers; and the migration may have lasted many generations rather than being a single event, so we needn't imagine 100000 newcomers showing up in the space of a few years. It was probably more of a steady trickle (which doesn't mean that some people, Gildas among them, wouldn't have noticed the change).

But we should remember that the Late Antique world (and the ancient world, too) was characterized by mobility. Saxons were moving into Britain to serve in the Roman army in the 4th century, and Saxons were crossing into Britain in the 7th century too. Barbarians were constantly crossing into the Roman empire before its power weakened, and the mobility of people in the 'migration age' was not a *new* phenomenon.

Hence, we should be careful not to assign too much explanatory power to migration in understanding why early Anglo-Saxon England looked so different from late Roman Britain. Personally, I think that technological change, related to economic changes, is the real source of England's new culture.

Halsall's book will give you a great perspective on all this (it's one of my favorites on this subject). I would also recommend Robin Fleming, *Britain After Rome*, and James Gerrard, *The Ruin of Roman Britain*. Fleming is more readable (and more affordable) than Gerrard, though both are excellent.
