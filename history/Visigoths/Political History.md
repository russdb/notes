*Visigothic Spain 409–711, Roger Collins*

### Political History

From Empire to Kingdom, 409–507  

If a date had to be set for the ending of Roman imperial rule in the Iberian peninsula, the autumn of 409 would be as good a one as any. On either September 28 or October 12 of that year – an all too typical contradiction between two contemporary sources makes it impos- sible to choose between them –  

loose and recently formed alliance of “barbarians,” ([[Alans]], the [[Sueves]], and the [[Vandals]].) came through the passes over the the Pyrenees into Spain.  

Whether the Spanish priest Orosius, writing his Seven Books of Histories Against the Pagans in 417, was right in suggesting that Constantine’s soldiers deliberately allowed the Vandals and the others across the Pyrenees in order to conceal the looting of the civilian population they themselves had been carrying out is impossible to tell. But the Roman government of the legitimate western emperor Honorius (395–423) was never able thereafter to reimpose its authority on all of the Spanish provinces.  

probably seeking to reach some form of accommodation with the Roman government, by offering to provide military service in return for regular pay and supplies 

in such periods of disturbance there were more potential soldiers looking for government subsidy than either were required or could be afforded by  

They were not able to maintain themselves as armies without access to regular food supplies, and they could not disperse widely over the countryside if faced by a military threat from hostile Roman forces  


seem to have made a treaty of federation
with a Roman government.
