over time, it switches from functional to territorial sphere of action. This was the result of the military commanders taking on a range of “civil” activities  such as tax gathering and legal roles    

provinces were additionally broken down into units known as conventus.

conventus took on a formal administrative role thatwasmainly judicial. It no longer referred to an association, but to a “geographic region comprising many lesser towns  

Such towns also fulfilled important commercial, administrative and religious functions as central sites within their regions and over time they came to operate as foci for civic identities that facilitated interaction with the imperial power.
