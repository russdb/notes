### Hispania  
Commonly used to describe the #iberian-peninsula  
Meaning of the term was flexible  
application of administration often modified in the face of ongoing tensions between central and regional #elites  

strength of the Roman system in Hispania lay in its ability to adapt in order to meet the military and bureaucratic needs of the state   

Roman hegemony across the western
Mediterranean meant that such flexibility was possible and the successful
“romanization” of Spain and other provinces was due to the creative interaction
of conqueror and the conquered rather than the imposition of imperial culture in
the provinces.  


the “Spains” of the Visigothic period were as flexible as those of the Romans:  

boundaries were consistently redrawn by political and ecclesiastical elites in response to the political and economic geography of the Iberian Peninsula, and in particular to its close and ongoing integration with the neighbouring regions of northern Africa and southern Gaul.
