### Regionalization of Visigothic Spain




gradual evolution best characterizes the transition from the Roman to the Visigothic period

pace of change was neither rapid nor uniform across the peninsula.  
Regions with a stronger tradition of alignment with Mediterranean economic systems were harder hit by the changing order

southeast of the peninsula was able to maintain contact with Africa  
well into the seventh century.  
Rural settlement patterns point towards the gradual development , with 
development of more regional identities across the peninsula,  
It was not until the last quarter of the sixth century that anything approaching
pan-Iberian political unity was attained again. The Visigoths moved slowly from being just one of many competing political powers within the peninsula to a position of dominance.

[[King Leovigild]] 
brought many local powers under his dominance,  conquest was accompanied by the refinement of a range of offices and bureaucratic processes that seem to have been designed to tie regional elites more firmly into the political centre at Toledo  

Partly this worked by giving them access to office, and partly by passing laws that reinforced their power in the provinces.67 In the realm of ideology, we see the projection of an image of political and religious unity and loyalty from the centre across a range of legal, historical, and ecclesiastical sources.  

After eliminating his rebellious son, he continued his expansionary activities, finally subduing the Suevic kingdom in 585, confirming the Visigothic monarchy as the dominant power in Spain, although as noted above, the Byzantine province of Spania was not suppressed until the 620s  

630s the Iberian Peninsula was unified under a single political power for
the first time since the beginning of the fifth century. Scholars used to consider this a singular moment of unity between state and church, the prototype for all subsequent centralizing regimes from the Catholic Monarchs to the Franco dictatorship.  

However, as we have already seen, kings struggled throughout the seventh century to establish their power in the face of intermittent opposition from the nobility in the provinces.7
