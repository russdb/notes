### Ecclesiastical Organization of Visigothic Spain


Analysis of the ecclesiastical structure of Iberia under the Visigoths further reveals
the “patchwork” nature of the country’s provincial organization and the dependency of boundaries on developing political power structures. 


Nicene Church seems to have been organized into provinces that broadly coincided with  those of the Tetrarchic diocese of Spain, although with some modifications. There were efforts to establish overarching ecclesiastical authorities.

may have in part been the result of the papacy’s recognition that in order to make its authority felt in Spain it was better to devolve responsibility to a local power  

bishoprics of Visigothic-controlled southern Gaul were integrated into the
ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Visigothic kingdom and took part in “national” church councils in Toledo, after the conversion of the Visigoths to Nicene Christianity in 589. Church  

Political boundaries thus conditioned the functioning of the ecclesiastical
infrastructure of the Visigothic territories of Gaul and Hispania.  

reinforced by the processes by which Visigothic power was consolidated in Iberia in the late sixth and early seventh centuries, creation of the ecclesiastical province of Carpetania, formed out of those parts which were not under Eastern Roman control, due to the desire of the political and ecclesiastical elite on the Visigothic side of the border to boost the status of Toledo, 

When the Suevic kingdom and Spania were conquered, bishoprics in those regions were reintegrated into the ecclesiastical provincial structure of Visigothic-controlled Iberia and church councils were held to try to smooth the process.  

although the provincial organization of the Church in Hispania was dependent on the exigencies of the political situation, the ecclesiastical authorities sought to realign the bishoprics into pre-established configurations as soon as they had the opportunity to do so.   

driven by the interests of the metropolitan bishops who had precedence within the overall province and individual bishops at the level of their diocese, both groups of which had an interest in maximizing the scope of their responsibilities  

  Royal and church laws were designed to demonstrate the symbolic power of the king and bishops  

Other policies and practices, such as laws which reinforced the power of local elites over their dependents, served the purposes of the provincial aristocracy and gave them a reason to buy into the central system  


[[conversion of the Visigoths]] from Arian to Nicene Christianity under King
Reccared in 587–89 was a turning point.  

. One of the key selling points of the Visigoths for bishops such as Isidore of Seville was their ability to maintain the unity of Spain  


Visigoths were rebranded gradually by Hispano-Roman Nicene
bishops, from heretical barbarian invaders to an orthodox Nicene people who were
“Roman” in all but name.  

bishops therefore consistently promoted the idea of a unified Spanish-Visigothic-Nicene identity against more localized modes of belonging, centralizing tendencies existed in constant tension with regional identities

The strident promotion of the Visigothic monarchy by the Spanish Nicene Church was
thus the result of its very shaky foundations on the ground in the provinces.
