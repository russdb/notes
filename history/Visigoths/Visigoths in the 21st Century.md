*Visigothic Spain 409â€“711, Roger Collins*

### Visigoths in the 21st Century  

the early fifth century to the beginning of the eighth, has both gained and lost from recent changes in scholarly taste and methodology. While it could never be described as over- whelmingly popular, its history was one of the subjects that used to benefit from something like an official seal of approval, not just in the time of General Franco but for much of the twentieth century. This was thanks to the dominant ideology of the time encouraging study of periods in the Spanish past in which the central power of the state was strong, and in which political unification was a favoured goal.1 For the medieval centuries this led to an almost exclusive interest in a succession of monarchies seen as contributing to the reuniting of the peninsula under strong royal and Christian leadership, with the concomitant destruction or ejection of those racial and cultural ele- ments regarded as alien to the true Spanish identity or Hispanidad
