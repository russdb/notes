### Connections across the pyrenees and the straits of gibraltar

Just as there were long-standing contacts between southern Iberia and northern Africa across the Straits of Gibraltar, so in the north the Pyrenees functioned more as a conduit than as a barrier to connectivity throughout the Roman and post- Roman periods. These contacts, which have been traced in the onomastic and toponymic registers, as well as in archaeological, architectural and numismatic evidence, were increased due to the integrative effect of the Roman imperial system.4  

material record for the late and post Roman periods demonstrates continued connectivity across the Pyrenees  

emergence of Christianity as the religion of empire during the fourth century occasioned further interactions between the supposedly separate provinces of Gaul and Hispanias  

[[Priscillianist controversy]], which may have precipitated the council at Zaragoza, also demonstrates connections between the provinces to the north and south of the Pyrenees.  
he was eventually executed on the charge of sorcery  
The key point here is that both Spanish and Gallic bishops intervened for and against Priscillian  

Informal aristocratic and ecclesiastical connections thus subverted the supposed boundaries separating the provinces of Gaul and Hispania.  

Roman government to utilize another barbarian group, the Visigoths, as foederati (federate troops) as part of efforts to retake control of the Peninsula.  

In 418 the Visigoths were settled in the province of Aquitania Secunda

gradual diminution of Roman power in Hispania over the remainder of the fifth century was accompanied by increasingly independent action by the Visigoths  


impetus to expansion in Iberia came in 507 when Gallic holdings were seriously reduced by the [[Franks]] who, under King Clovis (d. 511), defeated the Visigoths and killed their king at the Battle of Vouille´. The Visigothic kingdom was saved from total destruction by the intervention of the [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Theoderic the Great]] (d. 526).  

From the early sixth century, therefore, the remnants of Visigothic-controlled [[Gaul]] and Hispania became part of a greater Ostrogothic polity centred on Italy.  

should not imagine that the Visigoths were in complete control of Hispania
either before or after the disaster at Vouille.   

Although there are reports of kings and their forces in cities across the peninsula during the first half of the sixth century, this does not constitute definitive proof of permanent Visigothic control. The conquest of Hispania was a drawn-out process and not completed until the final quarter of the century.4  

economic, political, and military contact across the Straits of Gibraltar had been common throughout antiquity.48 These contacts continued as the Visigoths extended their control over Hispania in the course of the sixth century.  

Eastern Roman Empire had not given up hope of regaining control of the
western provinces and this was to lead to further interaction across the Straits  

between Cartagena and Ma´laga, although the province, known as Spania, was not taken by the Visigoths until the 620s.52 It is likely that Spania was under the jurisdiction of the African exarchate.53 The small distance that separated Hispania from Africa meant that any power wishing to secure their possessions on one side was almost inevitably drawn to intervene on the other   

considerable debate in recent years over the nature of a frontier
between Spania and the territory that was under Visigothic control  

very difficult to identify which areas were under Visigothic and Eastern Roman control  

regardless, material evidence suggests that there was considerable interaction across the “border  

area of south-eastern Spain that was conquered by Eastern Roman forces was thus as integrated administratively and economically with Africa as it was with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, acting as a conduit for the exchange of goods, people, and ideas into the Visigothic kingdom  

kings seem to have recognized that it was in their strategic interests to cultivate their influence across the Straits into northern Africa. Their power in the Iberian Peninsula was by no means total. They had to compete with a range of local, regional, and international powers.
