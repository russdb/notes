### The Provinces and Regions of Late Roman Spain  

organization of Spain remained largely as it had under Augustus until the late third century CE.  

[[Diocletian]] (r. 284â€“305; d. 316), the empire was ruled under two senior emperors (Augusti) and two junior emperors, known as Caesars. Each of these four emperors ruled several dioceses which were in turn divided into a number of provinces. These provinces were often considerably smaller than those that had preceded them. In this system, the newly-created diocese of Spain was combined with Britain and Gaul under the rule of Caesar Constantius I Chlorus  

Baetica and Lusitania were maintained, the massive province of Hispania Citerior was broken up into Tarraconensis (capital Tarragona), Carthaginiensis (capital Cartagena, incorporating coastal areas southwest of Tarragona, extensive inland territories and the Balearic Islands), and Gallaecia in the northwest (capital Braga).
