### The Provinces and Regions of the Post Roman Spain  

Power waned quickly after 'barbarians' moved into spain in 406 AD. Rome used visigoths (remnants of [[alaric]])  


The empire seems to have maintained effective control in [[Tarraconensis]] and parts of [[Carthaginiensis]] until around 460.  

Recent work has demonstrated that in
post Roman Spain previous systems of administration and power endured at local
and regional levels for some time.  
the structures that it had imposed on the country lived on and served as foci


elites of post-Roman Spain continued to use the provincial vocabulary of the empire,

Chronicle of Bishop Hydatius of Lemica (d. late fifth century), which covers the years 378-468 and is particularly useful for the information it provides on the breakdown of Roman power in Spain in the mid-fifth century  

First, it demonstrates the narrowing of horizons in Spain as the era of Roman imperial control receded from memory. This is because, despite efforts to the contrary, Hydatius was unable to access much information about events outside of his native Gallaecia.  

Second, the work provides excellent evidence for the emergence of local “self-help” groups as individual cities and territories sought to achieve security in the face of the breakdown of the Roman military infrastructure in Spain  

Local leaders, especially bishops, took on greater responsibility in this time of upheaval as they sought security for their communities, replicating processes that were occurring all across the late antique Mediterranean.  

illustrates that the continuing vitality of the late Roman provincial vocabulary, if not the administrative machinery

the beginning of the fifth century suggests that the Roman provinces were still considered to be the basic building blocks of the Iberian Peninsula

> When the provinces of Spain had been laid waste by the destructive progress of the disasters just described, the Lord in his compassion turned the barbarians to the establishment of peace. They then apportioned to themselves by lot areas of the provinces for settlement: the Vandals took possession of Gallaecia and the Sueves that part of the Gallaecia which is situated on the very western edge of the Ocean. The Alans were allotted the provinces of Lusitania and Carthaginiensis, and the Siling Vandal Baetica.  

For all except the first decade of the fifth century it is very hard to speak of Hispania as a unified political or administrative entity
