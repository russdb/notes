'It's complicated.'

There are a few different ways to approach this question.

**Archaeological evidence**

In the 18th century, a man by the name of Bryan Faussett became very interested in the antiquities that workmen on his land were uncovering, particularly old rusted spearheads and jewelry from burials which he believed belonged to the Anglo-Saxon migrants that Bede tells us about.

Over the next 100 years, more and more of these antiquities were discovered (thanks in large part to the development of canal and rail networks, which caused large portions of the countryside to be excavated). By the 1870s, hundreds of middle class men with enough free time to invest in serious hobbies were studying this material in local antiquarian societies (universities did not, yet, have archaeology departments), and one group wrote a book in which they argued that these archaeological finds were the physical proof of the story that Bede told about the Anglo-Saxon conquest. They took it a step further, though, and mashed together all the different sources (from hundreds of years apart) into the incredibly detailed account with which we're all familiar (Hengist and Horsa, Vortigern, and the rest). This became standard reading for English school children, and formed the backbone of British national identity by the end of the 19th century. The WASP (white Anglo-Saxon protestant) identity emerged at the same time: nationalism was sweeping across the western world, and the Anglo-Saxon conquest was chosen as the moment when 'English' identity had been born.

Over the next century, archaeologists professionalized, and the amount of data they had at their disposal grew. Scholars like T.E. Leeds made maps of the 'Anglo-Saxon' finds, and used these maps to show where different kingdoms were, and how much land had been conquered. The idea was that if a particular style of brooch were found where Bede said the Jutes had landed, that brooch was 'Jutish' -- and if we mapped where all the Jutish brooches were found, we could draw a line / political boundary around the kingdom these conquerors formed (if this logic sounds a bit circular -- it is). Leeds gave us maps like [this one (published 1913)](http://andrewwelton.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image.jpeg).

However. A few things happened to cause this story to be questioned.

First, by the 1980s, it was becoming clear that the archaeology didn't tell such a simple story. There was a lot of stuff that archaeologists thought was 'Anglo-Saxon' -- but there was a lot of stuff that wasn't, as well. And the Anglo-Saxon stuff didn't look quite like the archaeology in Anglia or Saxony from the same period. In fact, a lot of it looked like a hybrid between 'Germanic' and Romano-British cultural styles. Archaeologists began to question just how many Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated -- perhaps it was only a small band of elites, who ruled a British population which adopted the dress and culture of their conquerors (a model known as 'elite replacement'). That is, maybe the Saxons didn't drive the British into Wales -- they just took them over from the top-down. In some cases, the cultures seemed to have blended: certain styles of jewelry looked like hybrids of earlier local styles with new styles that resembled those from Germany. Some archaeologists went so far as to question whether the conquest had happened at all: perhaps the British people merely adopted the *culture* of Saxony without a violent conquest. This peaceful version of events was encouraged as more and more Roman cities were excavated, and archaeologists found *no evidence* of the violent destruction that Gildas said had happened (Roman cities in Britain were peacefully abandoned, not sacked).

The second line of criticism, which is still ongoing, was theoretical. A number of archaeologists began to ask a really important question, which was: how do we know this jewelry, these weapons, etc are *Anglo-Saxon*? Remember that folks like Leeds had *assumed* that new jewelry styles found where Bede said the Jutes landed were Jutish styles. But the logic behind this is fuzzy: the jewelry is a new style, and it appears in one area, but the only reason to say it's *Jutish* is because we assume Bede was right that these people landed and lived in that part of England. But if we want to be really honest, all we have is a bunch of brooches: we don't know that these pins were worn by only *one* people group (maybe multiple groups wore them), we don't know that these people were *Jutish* (perhaps only local women conquered by the Jutes wore this jewelry -- we just don't know!), and we don't know whether the pattern we see might have been caused by something else like geography (similar objects are usually found along river valleys -- is that because everyone along the valley was a Jute, or because people traded jewelry up and down the river?). As a consequence, archaeologists started to look for new ways to talk about people groups that didn't just assume that you could tell where someone was from simply on the basis of the jewelry or weapons they had buried in their graves. (See Sam Lucy's book, *The Anglo-Saxon Way of Death* [2000] if you want to go into more detail on this debate). One of the ways we are doing this is with scientific evidence.

**Science**

There are a few new, exciting scientific methods we can use to trace where someone is from.

When we're young and our teeth are still forming, the minerals in our drinking water get trapped in our teeth. Depending on where you grow up, the ratios of stable isotopes in our water will vary slightly. By grinding up a person's tooth and measuring the ratios of Oxygen or Strontium, we can determine whether or not someone grew up in the village where they were buried. With Oxygen, we can usually also tell if they grew up to the west or east of this village: in Wales, or else in Germany.

In the past decade, many cemeteries have been studied with this method, and the results are fascinating. There *were* migrants from the Continent buried in English cemeteries -- but often, these weren't the people with the 'Angle' or 'Saxon' jewelry. The people with this 'foreign' jewelry are often locally born. In many cases, people migrated from the *west*, from Wales -- something that Gildas certainly never mentions (it's migration in the wrong direction!). This means that people did move -- but their movement was not a simple conquest from Germany to Britain. And the archaeological artefacts once thought to clearly mark the difference between Germanic migrants and locals is, as many critics had suspected, not so simple after all.

More recently, DNA has become another tool for tracing migrations. This has been done several different ways, and still has a lot of problems that have to be worked out. The most famous study looked at thousands of modern English persons' DNA, and looked for small mutations which can, through computer modeling, be related to populations in other modern European populations. One result of this study was the finding that people who live in lowland Britain (the area where the Angles and Saxons supposedly settled *are* related to people in N. Germany. The study authors argued that this was proof of the Anglo-Saxon migrations, and suggested that between 10-40% of the modern population in this region descended from these migrants. This is both much lower than was once thought (back when historians thought that the Anglo-Saxons drove all the Britons into Wales), but higher than some of the more skeptical critics had argued in the 80s.

There are problems with this study. For one, the mutation that links Germany and England diverged c. 800, 350 years after the Anglo-Saxon migration was supposed to have happened. Perhaps people were continuously traveling back and forth across the North Sea during this period, or perhaps some of the common DNA actually resulted from the Viking Invasions of the 9th century. There's ongoing debate. But it's interesting science.

Another study recovered the DNA from several ancient bodies in a cemetery in Cambridgeshire. It found that some bodies were very closely related to modern Continental populations, ie they were migrants from the Continent. Others were local Romano-British. And some were a mix between the two -- ie, they were intermarrying. They also did an istopic study of their teeth, and found that these people were eating the same diet. Ie, they weren't just making babies together, they were sharing meals. That, the lead investigator of the cemetery argued, suggests that we're not seeing Germanic rulers and British slaves; we're seeing a real community where the people of different ancestry were mingling.

More work along these lines is ongoing, and we'll see more interesting results soon I'm soon.
