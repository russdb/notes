Rosamond McKitterick's Charlemagne is the most up-to-date scholarly work. For a broader perspective, you might want to check out The Carolingian World (2011), which could be used as a textbook for an advanced history class but which I still find to be a straightforward and enjoyable read. And if you're willing to make the adjustment, there's nothing like going back to the sources. First and foremost is Einhard's Life of Charlemagne, which can be found in many different editions in print and online. I'd recommend the cheap Penguin edition in Two Lives of Charlemagne, which is a solid translation and includes what is still a quality introduction to this text. (McKitterick also opens up her book on Charlemagne with a good discussion of Einhard, who remains our most informative source on the man himself.) Going a bit deeper, you could also check out Carolingian Chronicles, which brings together some of our other most important sources alongside Einhard. Alternatively, you might look into Dutton's great anthology, Carolingian Civilization, which includes both Einhard and selections from the chronicles. I glanced through as much of Winston's Charlemagne as I could see on Amazon preview. It looks like a quick and fun read, which might be a good place to start, although I would hesitate to take his word as final on many key issues. We now understand the vitality of Merovingian kings, the relationship between church and state, and even the very notion of political power in the early middle ages completely differently from when Winston was writing in the mid-1950s. If you're looking for a quick sketch of Charlemagne's life, Winston's work seems to have weathered well, but I wouldn't trust it as a map to navigate the contours of Charlemagne's career as we understand it today.
